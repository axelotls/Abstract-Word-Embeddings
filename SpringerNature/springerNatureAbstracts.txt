This study investigates the residual compressive strength and modulus of elasticity of recycled aggregate concrete containing ground granulated blast furnace slag (RAC-GGBS) exposed to high temperatures, presents the numerical optimization of the mix design parameters of RAC-GGBS to achieve maximized residual compressive strength, and develops prediction models for residual compressive strength of RAC-GGBS based Gene expression programming (GEP) approach. The considered variables were the percentage replacement of RCA (50, 75, 100%), percentage replacement of GGBS (0, 20, 40, and 60%), water to binder ratio W/B (0.4 and 0.5), compressive strength ( f _cu) and exposed temperatures of 25 ℃ (room temperature), 200, 400, 600, and 800 ℃. The experimental results show that addition of GGBS significantly enhanced the residual compressive strength and modulus of elasticity of RAC-GGBS while the SEM analysis conducted revealed a more compact microstructure with fewer pores and micro-cracks and better stabilized C–S–H hydrate formed at ITZ of RAC containing GGBS compared to RAC without GGBS after exposure to high temperature. The optimum condition obtained for RAC-GGBS exposed to high temperatures was 99.8%, 46.0% and 0.45 for RCA, GGBS and W/B, respectively, having maximized residual compressive strengths of 24.0, 25.5, 22.4, 17.2, 7.3 MPa after 25 ℃, 200 ℃, 400 ℃, 600 ℃ and 800 ℃ temperatures, respectively. The predictive ability of GEP model is high with R ^2 values above 0.97 and low measured statistical errors. The mean absolute error (MAE) values of 0.889 and 1.244 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.064 and 1.502 for the training and validation datasets respectively, validate the GEP model's high accuracy and strong capacity to predict the residual compressive strength of RAC-GGBS.
This study focuses on the transport, deposition, and triggered immune response of intranasal vaccine droplets to the angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2-rich region, i.e., the olfactory region (OR), in the nasal cavity of a 6-year-old female to possibly prevent corona virus disease 19 (COVID-19). To investigate how administration strategy can influence nasal vaccine efficiency, a validated multi-scale model, i.e., computational fluid-particle dynamics (CFPD) and host-cell dynamics (HCD) model, was employed. Droplet deposition fraction, size change, residence time, and the area percentage of OR covered by the vaccine droplets, and triggered immune system response were predicted with different spray cone angles, initial droplet velocities, and compositions. Numerical results indicate that droplet initial velocity and composition have negligible influences on the vaccine delivery efficiency to OR. In contrast, the spray cone angle can significantly impact the vaccine delivery efficiency. The triggered immunity was not significantly influenced by the administration investigated in this study due to the low percentage of OR area covered by the droplets. To enhance the effectiveness of the intranasal vaccine to prevent COVID-19 infection, it is necessary to optimize the vaccine formulation and administration strategy so that the vaccine droplets can cover more epithelial cells in OR to minimize the number of available receptors for SARS-CoV-2.
Objective Advanced experimental methods such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) produced a large number of potential indicative genetic biomarkers and gene variants to diseases mentioned as research outputs in the scientific literature. To elucidate novel biomarkers and therapeutic candidates from this larger number of literature, highly sophisticated text mining-based knowledge-driven frameworks are a necessity. Materials and Methods This paper presents DisGeReExT Web server for performing a literature-wide analysis study (LWAS) to extract both direct and indirect gene–disease associations using joint ensemble learning (explicit) along with concept profiling using the ABC principle (implicit) for prioritizing and rationalizing potential informative discoveries of the genetic role on diseases. In addition, we ranked the informative sentences using a scoring model and calculated the disease–disease similarity using functional association among shared genes. Results From complete MEDLINE corpus dated September 2020 with 28 million records, DisGeReExT identified a total of 2,237,545 gene–disease associations and 2,851,662 disease–disease similarities. Discussion DisGeReExT was able to extract informative sentences related to both diseases and genes in large scale. It also explored the gene–disease association of two diseases, namely Alzheimer’s disease and liver carcinoma, and identified its top 10 associated genes and diseases of both diseases. Conclusion Overall, we strongly believe that our large-scale automated approach for knowledge discovery of gene-associated diseases from literature could provide new insights into the genetic mechanism and disease etiology and can play a pivotal role in translational research, drug discovery, and repurposing.
Nutraceuticals have attained substantial attention due to their health-boosting or disease-prevention characteristics. Growing awareness about the potential of nutraceuticals for the prevention and management of diseases affecting human has led to an increase in the market value of nutraceuticals in several billion dollars. Nevertheless, limitations in supply and isolation complications from plants, animals or fungi, limit the large-scale production of nutraceuticals. Microbial engineering at metabolic level has been proved as an environment friendly substitute for the chemical synthesis of nutraceuticals. Extensively used microbial systems such as E. coli and S. cerevisiae have been modified as versatile cell factories for the synthesis of diverse nutraceuticals. This review describes current interventions in metabolic engineering for synthesising some of the therapeutically important nutraceuticals (phenolic compounds, polyunsaturated fatty acids and carotenoids). We focus on the interventions in enhancing product yield through engineering at gene level or pathway level.
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disorder of unknown etiology. Multifactorial interaction among various susceptible factors such as environmental, hormonal, and genetic factors makes it more heterogeneous and complex. Genetic and epigenetic modifications have been realized to regulate the immunobiology of lupus through environmental modifications such as diet and nutrition. Although these interactions may vary from population to population, the understanding of these risk factors can enhance the perception of the mechanistic basis of lupus etiology. To recognize the recent advances in lupus, an electronic search was conducted among search engines such as Google Scholar and PubMed, where we found about 30.4% publications of total studies related to genetics and epigenetics, 33.5% publications related to immunobiology and 34% related to environmental factors. These outcomes suggested that management of diet and lifestyle have a direct relationship with the severity of lupus that influence via modulating the complex interaction among genetics and immunobiology. The present review emphasizes the knowledge about the multifactorial interactions between various susceptible factors based on recent advances that will further update the understanding of mechanisms involved in disease pathoetiology. Knowledge of these mechanisms will further assist in the creation of novel diagnostic and therapeutic options.
Co-contamination of hydrocarbons with heavy metals in soils often complicates and hinders bioremediation. A comprehensive characterization of site-specific degraders at contaminated sites can help determine if in situ bioremediation processes are sufficient. This study aimed to identify differences in benzene and toluene degradation rates and the microbial communities enriched under aerobic conditions when different concentrations of Cd and Pb are introduced. Microcosms were used to study the degradation of 0.23 mM benzene or 0.19 mM toluene under various concentrations of Pb (up to 240 µM) and Cd (up to 440 µM). Soil collected from a stormwater retention basin receiving runoff from a large parking lot was utilized to seed the microcosms. The hydrocarbon degradation time and rates were measured. After further rounds of amendment and degradation of benzene and toluene, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR were used to ascertain the microbial communities enriched under the various concentrations of the heavy metals. The initial degradation time for toluene and benzene was 7 to 9 days and 10 to 13 days, respectively. Degradation rates were similar for each hydrocarbon despite the concentration and presence of metal co-contaminant, however, the enriched microbial communities under each condition differed. Microcosms without metal co-contaminant contained a diversity of putative benzene and toluene degrading bacteria. Cd strongly reduced the richness of the microbial communities. With higher levels of heavy metals, genera such as Ralstonia , Cupriavidus , Azoarcus , and Rhodococcus became more dominant under various conditions. The study finds that highly efficient benzene- and toluene-degrading consortia can develop under variations of heavy metal co-contamination, but the consortia are dependent on the heavy metal type and concentrations.
In this study, we propose a model averaging approach to estimating the conditional quantiles based on a set of semiparametric varying coefficient models. Different from existing literature on the subject, we consider a particular form for all candidates, where there is only one varying coefficient in each sub-model, and all the candidates under investigation may be misspecified. We propose a weight choice criterion based on a leave-more-out cross-validation objective function. Moreover, the resulting averaging estimator is more robust against model misspecification due to the weighted coefficients that adjust the relative importance of the varying and constant coefficients for the same predictors. We prove out statistical properties for each sub-model and asymptotic optimality of the weight selection method. Simulation studies show that the proposed procedure has satisfactory prediction accuracy. An analysis of a skin cutaneous melanoma data further supports the merits of the proposed approach.
Sulfoxaflor (SUL, [ N -[methyloxido[1-[6-(trifluoromethyl)-3-pyridinyl] ethyl]- λ ^4-sulfanylidene] cyanamide]) is a widely used systemic insecticide, and its residue has frequently been detected in the environment, posing a potential threat to the environment. In this study, Pseudaminobacter salicylatoxidans CGMCC 1.17248 rapidly converted SUL into X11719474 via a hydration pathway mediated by two nitrile hydratases (AnhA and AnhB). Extensive (96.4%) degradation of 0.83 mmol/L SUL was achieved by P. salicylatoxidans CGMCC 1.17248 resting cells within 30 min (half-life of SUL 6.4 min). Cell immobilization by entrapment into calcium alginate remediated 82.8% of the SUL in 90 min, and almost no SUL was observed in surface water after incubation for 3 h. P. salicylatoxidans NHases AnhA and AnhB both hydrolyzed SUL to X11719474, although AnhA exhibited much better catalytic performance. The genome sequence of P. salicylatoxidans CGMCC 1.17248 revealed that this strain could efficiently eliminate nitrile-containing insecticides and adapt to harsh environments. We firstly found that UV irradiation transforms SUL to the derivatives X11719474 and X11721061, and the potential reaction pathways were proposed. These results further deepen our understanding of the mechanisms of SUL degradation as well as the environmental fate of SUL.
This research investigates the biodegradation of perchlorate in the presence of the co-contaminants nitrate and chlorate using soluble and slow-release carbon sources. In addition, the impact of bio-augmentation and dilution, which results in lower total dissolved salts (TDS) and contaminant levels, is examined. Laboratory microcosms were conducted using actual groundwater and soils from a contaminated aquifer. The results revealed that both soluble and slow-release carbon sources support biodegradation of contaminants in the sequence nitrate > chlorate > perchlorate. Degradation rates, including and excluding lag times, revealed that the overall impact of the presence of co-contaminants depends on degradation kinetics and the relative concentrations of the contaminants. When the lag time caused by the presence of the co-contaminants is considered, the degradation rates for chlorate and perchlorate were two to three times slower. The results also show that dilution causes lower initial contaminant concentrations, and consequently, slower degradation rates, which is not desirable. On the other hand, the dilution resulting from the injection of amendments to support remediation promotes desirably lower salinity levels. However, the salinity associated with the presence of sulfate does not inhibit biodegradation. The naturally occurring bacteria were able to support the degradation of all contaminants. Bio-augmentation was effective only in diluted microcosms. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were the dominant phyla identified in the microcosms. Graphical abstract 
In the fields of engineering and data sciences, the optimization problems arise on regular basis. With the progress in the field of scientific computing and research, the optimization is not a problem for small data sets and lower dimensional problems. The problem arise, when the data is large, stochastic in nature, and/or multidimensional. The basic optimization tools fail for such problems due to the complexity. The genetic algorithms, based on the natural selection hypothesis, play an imperative role to deal with such complex problems. Genetic algorithms are used in the literature to optimize numerous problems. In the field of computational biology, these algorithms have provided cost effective solutions to find optimal values for large data sets. The genetic algorithms have been used for image reconstruction. These algorithms are based on sub-algorithms to improve the accuracy and precision. We will discuss the advanced genetic algorithms and their applications in detail. Genetic algorithm, in hybrid form have attracted interest of researchers from almost all fields, including computer science, applied mathematics, engineering and computational biology. These tools help to analyze the systems in a swift manner. This important feature is discussed with the aid of examples. The time series forecasting and the Bayesian inference, in combination with the genetic algorithms, can prove to be powerful artificial intelligence tools. We will discuss this important aspect in detail with the aid of some examples.
3, 5, 6-Trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP) is a metabolite of the insecticide chlorpyrifos and the herbicide triclopyr, and it is higher toxic than the parent compounds. Microbially-mediated mineralization appears to be the primary degradative pathway and the important biological process of detoxification. However, little information is available on TCP complete metabolic pathways and mechanisms. In this study, the degradation of TCP was studied with a novel strain Micrococcus luteus ML isolated from a stable TCP degrading microbiota. Strain ML was capable of degrading 61.6% of TCP (50 mg/L) and 35.4% of chlorpyrifos (50 mg/L) at 24 h and 48 h under the optimal conditions (temperature: 35 °C; pH: 7.0), respectively. It could also degrade 3, 5-dichloro-2-pyridone, 6-chloropyridin-2-ol, 2-hydroxypyridine and phoxim when provided as sole carbon and energy sources. Seven TCP intermediate metabolites were detected in strain ML and two possible degradation pathways of TCP were proposed on the basis of LC–MS analysis. Both the hydrolytic-oxidative dechlorination pathway and the denitrification pathway might be involved in TCP biodegradation by strain ML. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on two different pathways responsible for TCP degradation in one strain, and this finding also provides novel information for studying the metabolic mechanism of TCP in pure culture.
Pullulan is a commercially available exopolymer biosynthesized by Aureobasidium pullulans supplemented with nitrogen, carbon and other vital components through submerged and solid-state fermentation. These nutrients are very expensive and it raises the cost for the production of pullulan. Hence, the need of alternative cost-effective raw materials for its production is a prerequisite. Owing to its unique physicochemical features, pullulan has various applications in the food, pharmacological, and biomedical domains. Food industrial wastes generate a considerable number of by-products which accumulates and has a negative influence on the environment. These by-products are made up of proteins, carbohydrates, and other components, can be employed as substrates for the production of pullulan. The present review briefs on the pullulan production using food processing waste and by-products and the elements that impact it. It provides an insight into versatile applications of pullulan in food industries. Various challenges and future prospects in the field of research on pullulan production have been uncovered.
The anticoagulation and hemostatic properties of blood-contacting materials are opposite lines of research, but their realization mechanisms are inspired by each other. Contact between blood and implantable biomaterials is a classic problem in tribological research, as both antithrombotic and hemostatic materials are closely associated with this problem. Thrombus formation on the surfaces of blood-contacting biomedical devices can detrimentally affect their performance and patient life, so specific surface functionalization is required. Currently, intensive research has focused on the development of super-lubricated or super-hydrophobic coatings, as well as coatings that deliver antithrombotic drugs. In addition, hemostatic biomaterials with porous structures, biochemical substances, and strongly adhesive hydrogels can be used to achieve rapid and effective hemostasis via physical or biochemical mechanisms. This article reviews methods of preparing anticoagulant coatings on material surfaces and the current status of rapid hemostatic materials. It also summarizes fundamental concepts for the design and synthesis of anticoagulant and hemostatic materials by discussing thrombosis and hemostasis mechanisms in biomedical devices and normal organisms. Because there are relatively few reports reviewing the progress in surface-functionalized design for anticoagulation and hemostasis, it is anticipated that this review can provide a useful summary of the applications of both bio-adhesion and bio-lubrication techniques in the field of biomedical engineering.
We report nine species of the Schistorchiinae Yamaguti, 1942 (Apocreadiidae Skrjabin, 1942) from Indo-Pacific marine fishes. Molecular data (ITS2 and 28S rDNA and cox 1 mtDNA) are provided for all species and the genus-level classification of the subfamily is revised. For Schistorchis Lühe, 1906, we report the type-species Sch. carneus Lühe, 1906 and Sch. skrjabini Parukhin, 1963. For Sphinteristomum Oshmarin, Mamaev & Parukhin, 1961 we report the type-species, Sph. acollum Oshmarin, Mamaev & Parukhin, 1961. We report and re-recognise Lobatotrema Manter, 1963, for the type and only species, L. aniferum Manter, 1963, previously a synonym of Sph. acollum . Lobatotrema aniferum is phylogenetically distant from, but morphologically similar to, Sph. acollum and Lobatotrema is recognised as a ‘cryptic genus’. We propose Blendiella n. gen. for B. trigintatestis n. sp. and B. tridecimtestis n. sp. These species are broadly consistent with the present morphological concept of Schistorchis but are phylogenetically distant from the type-species; a larger number of testes and some other subtle morphological characters in species of Blendiella serve to distinguish the two genera. We report three species of Paraschistorchis Blend, Karar & Dronen, 2017: P. stenosoma (Hanson, 1953) Blend, Karar & Dronen, 2017 (type-species), P. seychellesiensis (Toman, 1989) Blend, Karar & Dronen, 2017, and P. zancli (Hanson, 1953) Blend, Karar & Dronen, 2017. Lobatotrema aniferum, P. stenosoma, and Sch. carneus each have two distinct cox 1 populations either over geographical range or in sympatry. Available evidence suggests that most of these species, but not all, are widespread in the tropical Indo-Pacific.
Tetracycline (TC) is a widely used antibiotic with a complex aromatic chemical structure and is highly resistant to biodegradation. In this study, an SBR equipped with a vertical axially rotating biological bed (SBR-VARB) was used for the biodegradation and mineralization of TC. SBR-VARB showed high efficiency in removing TC (97%), total phenolic compounds (TP) (95%), and COD (85%) under optimal operating conditions (TC = 50 mg/L, HRT = 1.75 d, and OLR = 36 g COD/m^3 d). The SBR-VARB was able to treat higher concentrations of TC in shorter HRT than reported in previous studies. The contribution of VARB to improve SBR efficiency in removing TC, TP, and COD was 16, 36, and 48%, respectively. Intermediate compounds formed during the biodegradation of TC were identified using GC–MS under the optimal operating conditions of the bioreactor. These are mainly organic compounds with linear chemical structures. Based on the complete biodegradation of TC under the optimal operating conditions of the bioreactor, 93% and 36% of the chlorine and nitrogen atoms in the chemical structure of TC appeared in the wastewater, respectively. According to the sequence analysis of 16SrDNA, Pseudomonas sp., Kocuria Polaris , and Staphylococcus sp. were identified in the biofilm of VARB and the suspended biomass of the bioreactor. Therefore, SBR-VARB showed high efficiency in the biodegradation and mineralization of TC and can be used as a suitable option for treating wastewater containing antibiotics and other toxic compounds.
Increase of greenhouse gases and pollution of environment due to use of conventional sources of energy has made the world aware of the need to increase the use of renewable energy sources like solar power, wind power and hydropower. The scope of the solar power is vast and proper optimization of solar power plants can fulfill varying load demands. This paper studies an optimization technique for such a purpose. Estimation of ideal solar power plant sizes is done for fulfilling the load requirements of selected four districts of Madhya Pradesh, a state in the central part of India. The districts are chosen on the basis of solar irradiance and land availability. In this paper, installation of solar power plants of required sizes is recommended at each district to meet their power demands locally as well as to supply the nearby districts when needed. This will reduce the reliance on grid for energy supply and help in making the system more decentralized and distributed. It also reduces significantly the losses incurred during transmission and distribution. This paper presents the problem of power plant size estimation as a multi objective optimization problem. The first objective is to minimize the gap between power demand and generation in each district on a monthly basis. The second objective minimizes the cost of each unit of electricity generated. The third objective deals with minimizing the transmission and distribution losses on supplying power from one district to another. The genetic algorithm is used for solving this multi objective problem. The selected plant installation sites have the minimum capacity utilization factor of 18%. The simulation of the proposed optimization technique shows that the plant size obtained by the algorithm closely follows the objectives set.
Additive manufacturing (AM) technology uses the layer-by-layer stacking method to print parts, which simplifies the process of complex parts. The requirements for batch printing in AM are continuously growing now. In order to improve the economic and time efficiency of AM, the printing layout needs to be optimized. However, considering the diversity of part construction directions and accuracy requirements, as well as the limitations of time and materials, the printing layout still lacks comprehensive optimization models and methods, and the existing placement algorithms have not effectively utilized the holes inside parts and gaps between parts. In this paper, a comprehensive weighted general optimization model for 2D nesting is proposed to maximize time and economic benefits in AM. Moreover, a contour similarity matching method based on chain code for part placement is proposed to solve the problems about utilizing holes and gaps for the compact layout, and the approximate optimal solution is obtained by integrating annealing evolution algorithm. Experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for regular geometry and real-world part layout.
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease. Its variable course makes it difficult to standardize patient treatment. This article aims at a literature review on available drugs for treating SLE and on drugs that have shown therapeutic effects in this disease. The PubMed/MEDLINE electronic search engine was used to identify relevant studies. This review presents the current therapeutic options, new biological therapies, and combination therapies of biologics with standard immunosuppressive and immunomodulating drugs. We have also underlined the importance to implement the treat-to-target strategy aimed at reducing or discontinuing therapy with glucocorticosteroids (GCs). The awareness of the benefits and risks of using GCs helps in refining their dosage and thereby obtaining a better safety profile. The advent of biological targeted therapies, and more recently, low-molecular-weight compounds such as kinase inhibitors, initiated numerous clinical trials in SLE patients and led to the approval of two biological drugs, belimumab, and anifrolumab, for SLE treatment. Progress in the treatment of SLE was reflected in the 2019 and 2021 recommendations of the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR). However, a mass of recent clinical research data requires continuous consolidation to optimize patient outcomes.
Recent technologies advancements promise to change our lives dramatically in the near future. A new different living society is progressively emerging, witnessed from the conception of novel digital ecosystems, where humans are expected to share their own spaces and habits with machines. Humanoid robots are more and more being developed and provided with enriched functionalities; however, they are still lacking in many ways. One important goal in this sense is to enrich their cognitive capabilities, to make them more “intelligent” in order to better support humans in both daily and special activities. The goal of this research is to set a step in bridging the gap between symbolic AI and connectionist approaches in the context of knowledge acquisition and conceptualization. Hence, we present a combined approach based on semantics and machine learning techniques for improving robots cognitive capabilities. This is part of a wider framework that covers several aspects of knowledge management, from representation and conceptualization, to acquisition, sharing and interaction with humans. Our focus in this work is in particular on the development and implementation of techniques for knowledge acquisition. Such techniques are discussed and validated through experiments, carried out on a real robotic platform, showing the effectiveness of our approach. The results obtained confirmed that the combination of the approaches gives superior performance with respect to when they are considered individually.
Forecasting the water levels in rivers and lakes is critical for flood warnings and water-resource management. Many soft computing techniques have been implemented for the prediction of water levels in lakes. While several deep learning models have been adopted, the comparison of the performance of these models with machine learning models is quite limited. In this study, the water level of Jezioro Kosno Lake in Poland has been predicted using 30 years of daily water level data through tree-based machine learning techniques, namely Random Forest and XGBoost, as well as deep learning techniques, namely bidirectional LSTM, convolutional 1D-BiLSTM, and recurrent neural network. The performance of the models was diagnosed using several statistical indicators such as mean square error (MSE), index of agreement (IA), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE), and symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE). The results suggest that XGBoost performs well in water level forecasting among the tree-based machine learning models. Among the deep learning models, the Conv1D-BiLSTM model performs unconditionally well. It is observed that XGBoost with the lowest RMSE value of 0.0066 and highest accuracy of 99.976 has outperformed all other models, and therefore, machine learning has performed better than deep learning for the current study.
Onions are always in high demand owing to various culinary as well as health protective properties and these days there is increased consumer preference for ready-to-eat or ready-to-cook onions. In this context, the current study was aimed to extend the keeping quality of minimally processed onions for an extended period while ensuring microbial safety as well as sprouting inhibition through an integrated approach. The optimized combinatorial approach included gamma radiation treatment (D_ min 60 Gy), minimal processing (de-skinning and scooping) and packaging in trays wrapped with polypropylene (PP; 10 µm thick) film followed by storage at low temperature (4–6 °C, relative humidity RH 65–70%). The parameters like shelf life, physico-chemical (colorimetry, moisture), organoleptic and nutritional properties were comprehensively assessed and found to be well retained up to 30 days with moisture loss of ≤ 5% and overall acceptability rating of 7 on 9-point hedonic scale. Microbiological analyses confirmed absence of Salmonella spp in these stored onions thus ensuring microbial safety. Nutritional profiling including carbohydrate, protein, fat, energy, and ash content revealed no significant change due to the processing as well as during storage. Thus, the radiation processing of freshly harvested bulbs followed by minimal processing, packing in formulated package and storage under low temperature conditions were found acceptable up to 30 days in the ready-to-eat form. Current findings provide credible evidences ascertaining extended shelf-life as well ensuring microbial safety of processed onions for commercial utilization by the food industries.
Plastic accumulation has become a serious environmental threat. Mitigation of plastic is important to save the ecosystem of our planet. With current research being focused on microbial degradation of plastics, microbes with the potential to degrade polyethylene were isolated in this study. In vitro studies were performed to define the correlation between the degrading capability of the isolates and laccase, a common oxidase enzyme. Instrumental analyses were used to evaluate morphological and chemical modifications in polyethylene, which demonstrated a steady onset of the degradation process in case of both isolates, Pseudomonas aeruginosa O1-P and Bacillus cereus O2-B. To understand the efficiency of laccase in degrading other common polymers, in silico approach was employed, for which 3D structures of laccase in both the isolates were constructed via homology modeling and molecular docking was performed, revealing that the enzyme laccase can be exploited to degrade a wide range of polymers.

Priorities in multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) convey the relevance preference of one criterion over another, which is usually reflected by imposing the non-negativity and unit-sum constraints. The processing of such priorities is different than other unconstrained data, but this point is often neglected by researchers, which results in fallacious statistical analysis. This article studies three prevalent fallacies in group MCDM along with solutions based on compositional data analysis to avoid misusing statistical operations. First, we use a compositional approach to aggregate the priorities of a group of DMs and show that the outcome of the compositional analysis is identical to the normalized geometric mean, meaning that the arithmetic mean should be avoided. Furthermore, a new aggregation method is developed, which is a robust surrogate for the geometric mean. We also discuss the errors in computing measures of dispersion, including standard deviation and distance functions. Discussing the fallacies in computing the standard deviation, we provide a probabilistic criteria ranking by developing proper Bayesian tests, where we calculate the extent to which a criterion is more important than another. Finally, we explain the errors in computing the distance between priorities, and a clustering algorithm is specially tailored based on proper distance metrics.
Objective Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is one of the commonest systemic complications in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and carries a significant morbidity and mortality burden. We aimed to identify key variables to risk-stratify RA patients in order to identify those at increased risk of developing ILD. We propose a probability score based on the identification of these variables. Methods A retrospective, multicentre study using clinical data collected between 2010 and 2020, across 20 centres. Results A total of 430 RA (210 with ILD confirmed on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT)) patients were evaluated. We explored several independent variables for the risk of developing ILD in RA and found that the key significant variables were smoking (past or present), older age and positive rheumatoid factor/anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to form a scoring system for categorising patients into high and low risk on a scale of 0–9 points and a cut-off score of 5, based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.76 (CI 95% 0.71–0.82). This yielded a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 58%. High-risk patients should be considered for investigation with HRCT and monitored closely. Conclusion We have proposed a new model for identifying RA patients at risk of developing ILD. This approach identified four simple clinical variables: age, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies, Rheumatoid factor and smoking, which allowed development of a predictive scoring system for the presence of ILD in patients with RA.
There is a growing demand of bioinspired wound-healing platforms with superior tissue repairing and low immunogenicity. Hyaluronic acid (HA) and sericin (Sc) are extensively used for their competence in tissue engineering and gene/drug delivery. Herein, we demonstrate the formation of hybrid nanoparticles of HA and Sc (HS NPs) taking advantage of the dynamic disulfide bonding between their thiolated derivatives. The fabricated HS NPs were loaded with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDC), a known suppressor for NF-κB expression, and explored for the cellular response of designed hybrid UDC-HS NPs. The cytotoxicity of the synthesized hybrid system was evaluated on CCD-986Sk cells, showing negligible cytotoxicity with the cell proliferation data supporting the potential of UDC-HS NPs in increasing the cell density. Moreover, UDC-HS NPs also directed enhanced antioxidant activity. Furthermore, the wound-healing capability of UDC-HS NPs was investigated through in vitro scratch assay on CCD-986Sk cells. The results obtained could provide a useful approach in designing hybrid nanoplatform with implications in wound repair and tissue regeneration.
This research focuses primarily on developing a comprehensive mix proportioning framework for Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC) with Silica Fume (SF). Initially, the mix proportioning of the blended concrete (SCC-SF) is perceived from literature using standard EFNARC guidelines. Using the discerned mix proportioning for SCC-SF, suitable concrete samples were prepared with varying quantities of concrete constituents, mineral admixtures, and different dosages of chemical admixtures, to interpret the fresh and hardened properties of the SCC-SF mixtures. The standard tests for fresh SCC such as L-box test, U-box, V-funnel test, and so on, were carried out for these blended mixtures. Furthermore, the compressive strength test for hardened SCC-SF concrete samples was performed. The experimental results of these fresh and hardened SCC-SF samples are incorporated into a machine learning methodology known as Decision Tree to get further insights on the functional requirements of the SCC-SF mixtures. Additionally, the inherent functional properties of SCC-SF are investigated through a novel mix proportioning methodology termed as Axiomatic Mix Proportioning (AMP) framework, which was developed based on an innovative systems design principle, known as Axiomatic Design. With AMP, the Functional Requirements (FRs) of SCC-SF such as workability, filling ability, passing ability, segregation resistance and compressive strength are investigated concerning its Design Parameters (DPs), i.e. constituents of SCC-SF. Ultimately, with the proposed AMP framework for SCC-SF, a comprehensive nomogram is developed to ease the mix proportioning of SCC-SF. From the nomogram, twenty-two optimal mix proportioning schema were generated. The optimal percentage of mineral admixture (SF), and dosage of chemical admixtures (Superplasticizer-SP, Viscosity Modifying Admixture-VMA, and Air-Entraining Admixture-AEA) to be used in SCC-SF to get maximum compressive strength (52 MPa) are 21.0 kg/m $$^3$$ 3 ( $$\approx$$ ≈ 6 % of cement by weight), 2.3 kg/m $$^3$$ 3 , 0.47 kg/m $$^3$$ 3 , and 1.97 kg/m $$^3$$ 3 , respectively. To validate the nomogram, additional twenty-two sets of SCC-SF samples were prepared, and fresh and hardened concrete tests were carried out. The test results of these additional twenty-two SCC-SF samples and the values of the corresponding sets in the nomogram perfectly correlate, and the percentage of deviations observed was very minimal.
Selected antifungal lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from mature spontaneous quinoa sourdough was used as potential starter culture to produce loaf wheat bread containing controlled fermented quinoa (CFQ) supplemented with red lentil (RL) flour. Phylogenetic evolutionary tree led to the identification of Enterococcus hirae as the selected LAB isolate. Furthermore, there was no significant difference ( P  > 0.05) between bread containing CFQ and control in terms of hardness. The highest loaf specific volume and overall acceptability were also observed in control sample and wheat bread containing CFQ + RL, respectively. Meanwhile, the rate of surface fungal growth on wheat bread enriched with CFQ was significantly lower than the other samples. In accordance with a non-linear multivariable model, positive and negative correlations were observed between porosity and specific volume (+ 0.79), and also specific volume and crumb hardness (− 0.70), respectively. Accordingly, CFQ can be used as bio-preservative to produce clean-label supplemented wheat bread.
Many a times a need may arise to estimate either a certain ratio or the sum of the shape parameters of two independent gamma populations. We try to tackle this problem through appropriate and novel two-stage sampling strategies. The first part of this paper deals with developing a two-stage methodology to estimate the ratio $$\alpha /(\alpha +\beta )$$ α / ( α + β ) coming from two independent gamma populations with parameters $$(\alpha ,1)$$ ( α , 1 ) and $$(\beta ,1)$$ ( β , 1 ) respectively. We assume a weighted squared error loss function and aim at controlling the associated risk function per unit cost by bounding it from above by a known constant $$\omega .$$ ω . We also establish first-order properties of our stopping rules. The second part of this paper deals with obtaining a two-stage sampling procedure to estimate the sum $$\alpha +\beta $$ α + β instead. We also provide extensive simulation analysis and real data analysis using data from cancer studies to show encouraging performances of our proposed stopping strategies.
Postpartum depression (PPD) is a serious mood disorder that tends to occur after the delivery, which may bring lifelong consequences to women and their families in terms of family relationships, social relationships, and mental health. Currently, various risk factors including environmental factors and genetic factors that may induce postpartum depression have been extensively studied. In this review, we suggest that postpartum women’s susceptibility to postpartum depression may be the result of the interaction between the genes associated with postpartum depression as well as the interaction between genetic and environmental factors. We reviewed the genes that have been studied in postpartum depression, including genes related to the synthesis, metabolism, and transport of monoamine neurotransmitters, key molecules of the HPA axis, and the kynurenine pathway. These studies have found more or less gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, so we will discuss these issues in more detail. However, so far, the conclusions of these risk factors, especially genetic factors, are not completely consistent in the occurrence and exacerbation of symptoms in postpartum depression, and it is not clear how these risk factors specifically participate in the pathological mechanism of the disease and play a role. We conclude that the role of genetic polymorphisms, including genetic and epigenetic processes, in the occurrence and development of postpartum depression, is complex and ambiguous. We also note that interactions between multiple candidate genes and the environment have been suggested as causes of depression, suggesting that more definitive research is needed to understand the heritability and susceptibility of PPD. Overall, our work supports the hypothesis that postpartum depression is more likely to be caused by a combination of multiple genetic and environmental factors than by a single genetic or environmental influence.
WRKY transcription factors play an important role in the immune system and the innate defense response of plants. WRKY transcription factors have great feedback on nitrogen stress. In this study, bioinformatics was used to detect the WRKY s of Panax notoginseng ( PnWRKYs ). The response of PnWRKYs under nitrogen stress was also well studied. PnWRKYs were distributed on 11 chromosomes. According to PnWRKY and Arabidopsis thaliana WRKY (AtWRKY) domains, these PnWRKY proteins were divided into three groups by phylogenetic analysis. MEME analysis showed that almost every member contained motif 1 and motif 2. PlantCARE online predicted the cis-acting elements of the promoter. PnWRKY gene family members obtained 22 pairs of repeat fragments by collinearity analysis. The expression levels of PnWRKYs in different parts (roots, flowers, and leafs) were analyzed by the gene expression pattern. They reflected tissue-specific expressions. The qRT-PCR experiments were used to detect 74 PnWRKYs under nitrogen stress. The results showed that the expression levels of 8 PnWRKYs were significantly induced. The PnWRKY gene family may be involved in biotic/abiotic stresses and hormone induction. This study will not only lay the foundation to explore the functions of PnWRKYs but also provide candidate genes for the future improvement of P. notoginseng .
CONSTANS - LIKE ( COL ) genes are considered the core components in photoperiod regulation and contribute to flowering regulation. Liriodendron chinense is a rare relict plant of the Magnoliaceae family. Having beautiful flowers like a tulip, L. chinense is now popularly used as an ornamental tree species. However, the COL genes of L. chinense have not yet been investigated. Here, we multidimensionally identify and characterize the COL genes in L. chinense , including their phylogenetic relationships, conserved motifs, cis -acting elements, expression patterns, and ectopic transformations. Nine LcCOL genes were identified across the L. chinense genome and were located on seven chromosomes. These nine LcCOL genes could be phylogenetically clustered into three groups (I, II, and III), with three, five and one COL members in each group, respectively. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) showed that the expression of LcCOL genes exhibited diverse patterns in various tissues. Moreover, LcCO and LcCOL3 displayed seasonal patterns, indicating that LcCO and LcCOL3 may play roles in flowering regulation. To analyze the function of the LcCO gene, we subsequently transferred LcCO into Arabidopsis thaliana via agrobacterium inflorescence infection, and found that overexpression of LcCO in A. thaliana caused earlier flowering and fewer rosette leaves under long-day condition. By RT-qPCR, we show that overexpression of LcCO co-regulates the expression of AtFLC , AtSOC1 and AtFT in transgenic Arabidopsis. Our study identified the COL members in L. chinense genome and laid a cornerstone for further functional characterization of LcCOL genes.
miR-124 is a miRNA predominantly expressed in the nervous system and accounts for more than a quarter of the total miRNAs in the brain. It regulates neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, neuronal maturation, and synapse formation and is the most important miRNA in the brain. Furthermore, emerging evidence has suggested miR-124 may be associated with the pathogenesis of various neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we provide an overview of the role of miR-124 in neurodevelopment and the underling mechanisms, and finally, we prospect the significance of miR-124 research to the field of neuroscience.
Trypsin can significantly improve the storage quality of Cucumis sativus ( C. sativus ) due to its novel superoxide scavenging activity. Based on the results of physiological indices, an integrated analysis of widely targeted metabolomics and transcriptomics was carried out, gene function was further confirmed by VIGS, a potential molecular mechanism of resistance improvement of C. sativus due to flavonoid biosynthesis induced by trypsin was proposed and discussed. Transcriptomic results showed that 1,068 genes highly related to flavonoid biosynthesis gathered in the brown module were obtained by the advanced method WGCNA. An isomeric compound of dihydrochalcone, trilobatin, was likely to be the key metabolite regulated by trypsin. Results of O2PLS and co-expression network illustrated that CsUGT91C1 acted as the hub gene which regulated the biosynthesis of flavonoids, especially trilobatin, in C. sativus . CsUGT91C1 also played as a hub node in the Protein-Protein Interactions network of WGCNA screened genes (WSGs). GO and KEGG analyses of WSGs enriched the transferase activities, especially UDP-glycosyltransferase activity and KEGG pathways of “Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis (map00940)” and “Flavonoid biosynthesis (map00941)”. Results of webtools of the PlantCARE database identified the G-box region of CsUGT91C1 , which can bind to the transcription factor CsMYC2. The expression and biological effects of CsUGT91C1 were significantly impeded by the silencing of CsMYC2 through VIGS. The results of this study might give new insight into the exploration of the postharvest resistance mechanism of C. sativus induced by trypsin and provide useful information for the subsequent mining of resistance genes in C. sativus .

Identification of cancer subtypes based on molecular knowledge is crucial for improving the patient diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. In this work, we integrated copy number variations (CNVs) and transcriptomic data of Kidney Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma (KIRP) using a network diffusion strategy to stratify cancers into clinically and biologically relevant subtypes. We constructed GeneNet, a KIRP specific gene expression network from RNA-seq data. The copy number variation data was projected onto GeneNet and propagated on the network for clustering. We identified robust subtypes that are biologically informative and significantly associated with patient survival, tumor stage and clinical subtypes of KIRP. We performed a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) analysis of KIRP subtypes, which revealed the genes/silent players related to poor survival. A differential gene expression analysis between subtypes showed that genes related to immune, extracellular matrix organization, and genomic instability are upregulated in the poor survival group. Overall, the network-based approach revealed the molecular subtypes of KIRP and captured the relationship between gene expression and CNVs. This framework can be further expanded to integrate other omics data.
The increased metabolism in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) malignant cells resulted in the production of high levels of free radicals, called oxidative stress conditions. To avoid this situation, malignant cells produce a considerable amount of antioxidant agents, which will lead to the release of a continuous low level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing genomic damage and subsequent clonal evolution. SIRT1 has a key role in driving the adaptation to this condition, mainly through the deacetylation of FOXO3a that affects the expression of oxidative stress resistance target genes such as Catalase and Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). The aim of this study is to simultaneously investigate the expression of SIRT1, FOXO3a, and free radical-neutralizing enzymes such as Catalase and MnSOD in AML patients and measure their simultaneous change in relation to each other. The gene expression was analyzed using Real Time-PCR in 65 AML patients and 10 healthy controls. Our finding revealed that expression of SIRT1, FOXO3a, MnSOD and Catalase was significantly higher in AML patients in comparison to healthy controls. Also, there was a significant correlation between the expression of SIRT1 and FOXO3a, as well as among the expression of FOXO3a, MnSOD and Catalase genes in patients. According to the results, the expression of genes involved in oxidative stress resistance was higher in AML patients, which possibly contributed to the development of malignant clones. Also, the correlation between the expression of SIRT1 and FOXO3a gene reflects the importance of these two genes in increased oxidative stress resistance of cancer cells.
The transformation of environmental microorganisms by extracellular DNA is an overlooked mechanism of horizontal gene transfer and evolution. It initiates the acquisition of exogenous genes and propagates antimicrobial resistance alongside vertical and conjugative transfers. We combined mixed-culture biotechnology and Hi-C sequencing to elucidate the transformation of wastewater microorganisms with a synthetic plasmid encoding GFP and kanamycin resistance genes, in the mixed culture of chemostats exposed to kanamycin at concentrations representing wastewater, gut and polluted environments (0.01–2.5–50–100 mg L^−1). We found that the phylogenetically distant Gram-negative Runella (102 Hi-C links), Bosea (35), Gemmobacter (33) and Zoogloea (24) spp., and Gram-positive Microbacterium sp. (90) were transformed by the foreign plasmid, under high antibiotic exposure (50 mg L^−1). In addition, the antibiotic pressure shifted the origin of aminoglycoside resistance genes from genomic DNA to mobile genetic elements on plasmids accumulating in microorganisms. These results reveal the power of Hi-C sequencing to catch and surveil the transfer of xenogenetic elements inside microbiomes.
Histone proteins play a critical role in the primary organization of nucleosomes, which is the fundamental unit of chromatin. Among the five types of the histones, histone H3 has multiple variants, and the number differs among the species. Amongst histone H3 variants, centromeric histone H3 (CENH3) is crucial for centromere identification and proper chromosomal segregation during cell division. In the present study, we have identified 17 putative histone H3 genes of Brassica oleracea . Furthermore, we have done a detailed characterization of the CENH3 gene of B. oleracea . We showed that a single CENH3 gene exhibits allelic diversity with at least two alleles and alternative splicing pattern. Also, we have identified a CENH3 gene–specific co-dominant cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence marker SNP34(A/C) to distinguish CENH3 alleles and follow their expression in leaf and flower tissues. The gene structure analysis of the  CENH3 gene revealed the conserved 5′–CAGCAG–3′ sequence at the intron 3–exon 4 junction in B. oleracea, which serves as an alternative splicing site with one-codon (alanine) addition/deletion. However, this one-codon alternative splicing feature is not conserved in the CENH3 genes of wild allied Brassica species. Our finding suggests that transcriptional complexity and alternative splicing might play a key role in the transcriptional regulation and function of the CENH3 gene in B. oleracea . Altogether, data generated from the present study can serve as a primary information resource and can be used to engineer CENH3 gene towards developing haploid inducer lines in B. oleracea .
The divalent cation Magnesium (Mg^2+) is necessary for healthy plant development, growth, and defense. Plants acquire Mg^2+ from the soil and transport it throughout their body tissues with Mg^2+ transporter (MGT) proteins. Although several MGT genes have been discovered and described in rice, maize, and Arabidopsis , far less information is available regarding their diversity and function in other plant species. To address this knowledge gap, here we identified seven putative MGT genes ( CsMGT1 - CsMGT7 ) in Citrus sinensis , which were classified into four distinct clades through phylogenetic analysis. Gene structures, cis -acting regulatory elements, and conserved motifs were also analyzed. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) indicated that the seven CsMGT genes were constitutively expressed across a variety of plant tissues, with the exception of CsMGT5 , which lacked detectable expression in fruit peels and pulp. Furthermore, qRT-PCR indicated that the seven CsMGT genes responded differently to Mg^2+ deprivation in leaves and roots. Complementation assays using Salmonella typhimurium MM281 and yeast CM66 demonstrated that CsMGT7 possessed the strongest Mg^2+ transport capacity. We propose that CsMGT7 might serve as an Mg^2+ transporter and play a crucial role in Mg^2+ deficiency response. Our results will aid future research on the biological roles of MGT s in plants, which is beneficial for combining theoretical and application-based research in fruit plants.
Background Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly aggressive hematological malignancy, and there has not been any significant improvement in therapy of AML over the past several decades. The mRNA vaccines have become a promising strategy against multiple cancers, however, its application on AML remains undefined. In this study, we aimed to identify novel antigens for developing mRNA vaccines against AML and explore the immune landscape of AML to select appropriate patients for vaccination. Methods Genomic data and gene mutation data were retrieved from TCGA, GEO and cBioPortal, respectively. GEPIA2 was used to analyze differentially expressed genes. The single cell RNA-seq database Tumor Immune Single-cell Hub (TISCH) was used to explore the association between the potential tumor antigens and the infiltrating immune cells in the bone marrow. Consensus clustering analysis was applied to identify distinct immune subtypes. The correlation between the abundance of antigen presenting cells and the expression level of antigens was evaluated using Spearman correlation analysis. The characteristics of the tumor immune microenvironment in each subtype were investigated based on single-sample gene set enrichment analysis. Results Five potential tumor antigens were identified for mRNA vaccine from the pool of overexpressed and mutated genes, including CDH23, LRP1, MEFV, MYOF and SLC9A9, which were associated with infiltration of antigen-presenting immune cells (APCs). AML patients were stratified into two immune subtypes Cluster1 (C1) and Cluster2 (C2), which were characterized by distinct molecular and clinical features. C1 subtype demonstrated an immune-hot and immunosuppressive phenotype, while the C1 subtype had an immune-cold phenotype. Furthermore, the two immune subtype showed remarkably different expression of immune checkpoints, immunogenic cell death modulators and human leukocyte antigens. Conclusion CDH23, LRP1, MEFV, MYOF and SLC9A9 were potential antigens for developing AML mRNA vaccine, and AML patients in immune subtype 1 were suitable for vaccination.
Resprouting is crucial in population dynamics in response to wildfires or herbivory. This trait, common in angiosperms, is considered rare in conifers, being Pinus canariensis one of the few species able to resprout. We analyzed gene expression during wound-induced resprouting in 5 years-old Canarian pines. RNA was extracted at three different stages, including control samples from remote branches, representing immediate response to wounding (R0), resprouting initiation (R1), and elongation (R2), and then hybridized to a microarray designed with 15,000 cDNAs from Pinus canariensis transcriptome of meristematic activity. We found 1164 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs), of which 903 were significant in R0, 278 in R1, and 261 in R2. Genes related to defense- and stress-response were mainly found to be overexpressed at R0, while DEGs coding for transcription factors such as GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR (GRF), FLOWERING-PROMOTING FACTOR (FPF), and the HOMEODOMAIN LEUCINE ZIPPER Class IV (HD-ZIP IV), mainly related to outgrowth processes and lateral organogenesis in plants, showed overexpression at R1 and R2, when new shoots were emerging. This data was compared to differential gene expression during apical growth in P. canariensis , suggesting similarities between vegetative apical growth and regulation of lateral shoot development in response to mechanical wounding, but also yielding 32 DEGs exclusively overexpressed at some point during resprouting stages (R1 and/or R2). The implication of such transcription factor families, with important roles in leaf and inflorescence development also in flowering plants, suggests underlying homologies between common lateral organogenesis processes in angiosperms and resprouting in gymnosperms.
An emerging view regarding cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) is that it plays a critical role in tumorigenesis and immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME), but the clinical significance and biological functions of CAFs in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are still poorly explored. Here, we aimed to identify the CAF-related signature for NSCLC through integrative analyses of bulk and single-cell genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics profiling. Using CAF marker genes identified in weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we constructed and validated a CAF-based risk model that stratifies patients into two prognostic groups from four independent NSCLC cohorts. The high-score group exhibits a higher abundance of CAFs, decreased immune cell infiltration, increased epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), activated transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling, and a limited survival rate compared with the low-score group. Considering the immunosuppressive feature in the high-score group, we speculated an inferior clinical response for immunotherapy in these patients, and this association was successfully verified in two NSCLC cohorts treated with immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs). Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequence datasets were used to clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying the aggressive and immunosuppressive phenotype in the high-score group. We found that one of the genes in the risk model, filamin binding LIM protein 1 ( FBLIM1 ), is mainly expressed in fibroblasts and upregulated in CAFs compared to fibroblasts from normal tissue. FBLIM1 -positive CAF subtype was correlated with increased TGFβ expression, higher mesenchymal marker level, and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Finally, we demonstrated that FBLIM1 might serve as a poor prognostic marker for immunotherapy in clinical samples. In conclusion, we identified a novel CAF-based classifier with prognostic value in NSCLC patients and those treated with ICBs. Single-cell transcriptome profiling uncovered FBLIM1 -positive CAFs as an aggressive subtype with a high abundance of TGFβ, EMT, and an immunosuppressive phenotype in NSCLC.
Pancreatic β-cells and α-cells are both dysfunctional in type 1 diabetes (T1D) but, while β-cells are killed, α-cells survive. Exposure of islet cells to interferon-α (IFNα), a cytokine that is induced early in T1D pathogenesis, induces expression of both similar genes (such as HLA-related genes) and different genes (such as BCL2L1 , endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related genes, innate immune response genes and antiviral response genes) in β-cells and α-cells. Expression of candidate genes for T1D shows major differences between β-cells and α-cells. The antigen presentation capacity seems similar in β-cells and α-cells, but either α-cells are less antigenic than β-cells (perhaps owing to higher HLA-E expression) or their capacity to better endure viral infections and ER stress increases their survival when facing diabetogenic stressors and thus decreases antigen presentation. Pre-proglucagon processing in enteroendocrine cells might favour immune tolerance towards glucagon and further limit α-cell immunogenicity. In type 1 diabetes, the immune system destroys pancreatic β-cells but not neighbouring α-cells. Here, the authors describe the key differences between β-cells and α-cells that could account for their differential autoimmune vulnerability, and how these differences could result in the preferential endurance and survival of α-cells over β-cells. A perplexing feature of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is that the immune system destroys pancreatic β-cells but not neighbouring α-cells, even though both β-cells and α-cells are dysfunctional. Dysfunction, however, progresses to death only for β-cells. Recent findings indicate important differences between these two cell types. First, expression of BCL2L1 , a key antiapoptotic gene, is higher in α-cells than in β-cells. Second, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related genes are differentially expressed, with higher expression levels of pro-apoptotic CHOP in β-cells than in α-cells and higher expression levels of HSPA5 (which encodes the protective chaperone BiP) in α-cells than in β-cells. Third, expression of viral recognition and innate immune response genes is higher in α-cells than in β-cells, contributing to the enhanced resistance of α-cells to coxsackievirus infection. Fourth, expression of the immune-inhibitory HLA-E molecule is higher in α-cells than in β-cells. Of note, α-cells are less immunogenic than β-cells, and the CD8^+ T cells invading the islets in T1D are reactive to pre-proinsulin but not to glucagon. We suggest that this finding is a result of the enhanced capacity of the α-cell to endure viral infections and ER stress, which enables them to better survive early stressors that can cause cell death and consequently amplify antigen presentation to the immune system. Moreover, the processing of the pre-proglucagon precursor in enteroendocrine cells might favour immune tolerance towards this potential self-antigen compared to pre-proinsulin.
Gibberellin, as one of the pivotal plant growth regulators, can improve fruit quality by altering fruit size and secondary metabolite content. Flavonoids are the most abundant secondary metabolites in grapes, which influence the color and quality of the fruit. However, the molecular mechanism of whether and how GA_3 affects flavonoid metabolism has not been reported, especially for the ‘Red globe’ grape with delayed cultivation in Hexi corridor. In the present study, the ‘Red globe’ grape grown in delayed facilities was sprayed with 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 mg/L GA_3 at berries pea size (BPS), veraison (V) and berries ripe (BR), respectively. The results showed that the berry weight, soluble sugar content and secondary metabolite content (the flavonoid content, anthocyanin content and polyphenol content) at BR under 80 mg/L GA_3 treatment were remarkably increased compared with other concentration treatments. Therefore, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to analyze the differentially expressed genes (DEG_S) and pathways under 80 mg/L GA_3 treatment at three periods. GO analysis showed that DEGs were closely related to transporter activity, cofactor binding, photosynthetic membrane, thylakoid, ribosome biogenesis and other items. The KEGG enrichment analysis found that the DEGs were mainly involved in flavonoid biosynthesis and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, indicating GA_3 exerted an impact on the color and quality of berries through these pathways. In conclusion, GA_3 significantly increased the expression of genes related to flavonoid synthesis, enhanced the production of secondary metabolites, and improved fruit quality. In addition, these findings can provide a theoretical basis for GA_3 to modulate the accumulation and metabolism of flavonoids in grape fruit.
Immunotherapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing tumor cell killing by tumor-specific T cells hold great potential for reducing tumor burden and prolonging survival of cancer patients. Although many potential tumor antigens have been described, identifying relevant targets when designing anti-cancer vaccines or targeted cell therapies remains a challenge. To identify novel, potentially immunogenic candidate tumor antigens, we performed integrated tumor transcriptomic, seromic, and proteomic analyses of high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) patient tumor samples. We identified tumor neo-antigens and over-expressed antigens using whole exome and RNA sequencing and examined these in relation to patient-matched auto-antibody repertoires. Focusing on MHC class I epitopes recognized by CD8^+ T cells, HLA-binding epitopes were identified or predicted from the highly expressed, mutated, or auto-antibody target antigen, or MHC-associated peptides (MAPs). Recognition of candidate antigenic peptides was assessed within the tumor-infiltrating T lymphocyte (TIL) population expanded from each patient. Known tumor-associated antigens (TAA) and cancer/testis antigens (CTA) were commonly found in the auto-antibody and MAP repertoires and CD8^+ TILs recognizing epitopes from these antigens were detected, although neither expression level nor the presence of auto-antibodies correlated with TIL recognition. Auto-antibodies against tumor-mutated antigens were found in most patients, however, no TIL recognition of the highest predicted affinity neo-epitopes was detected. Using high expression level, auto-antibody recognition, and epitope prediction algorithms, we identified epitopes in 5 novel antigens (MOB1A, SOCS3, TUBB, PRKAR1A, CCDC6) recognized by HGSC patient TILs. Furthermore, selection of epitopes from the MAP repertoire identified 5 additional targets commonly recognized by multiple patient TILs. We find that the repertoire of TIL specificities includes recognition of highly expressed and immunogenic self-antigens that are processed and presented by tumors. These results indicate an ongoing autoimmune response against a range of self-antigens targeted by HGSC TILs.
Bixin is a commercially valuable apocarotenoid pigment found in the seed aril of Bixa orellana . The dynamics and regulation of its biosynthesis and accumulation during seed development remain largely unknown. Here, we combined chemical, anatomical, and transcriptomic data to provide stage-specific resolution of the cellular and molecular events occurring during B. orellana seed development. Seeds at five developmental stages (S1–S5) were used for analysis of bixin content and seed anatomy, and three of them (S1, S3, and S4) were selected for Illumina HiSeq sequencing. Bixin accumulated in large quantities in seeds compared with other tissues analyzed, particularly during the S2 stage, peaking at the S4 stage, and then decreasing slightly in the S5 stage. Anatomical analysis revealed that bixin accumulated in the large central vacuole of specialized cells, which were scattered throughout the developing mesotesta at the S2 stage, but enlarged progressively at later stages, until they occupied most of the parenchyma in the aril. A total of 13 million reads were generated and assembled into 73,381 protein-encoding contigs, from which 312 were identified as containing 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate/2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (DOXP/MEP), carotenoid, and bixin pathways genes. Differential transcriptome expression analysis of these genes revealed that 50 of them were sequentially and differentially expressed through the seed developmental stages analyzed, including seven carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases, eight aldehyde dehydrogenases, and 22 methyltransferases. Taken together, these results show that bixin synthesis and accumulation in seeds of B. orellana are a developmentally regulated process involving the coordinated expression of DOXP/MEP, carotenoid, and bixin biosynthesis genes.
The classic BCR-ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) is a highly heterogeneous hematologic tumor that includes three subtypes, namely polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Despite having the same JAK2^V617F mutation, the clinical manifestations of these three subtypes of MPN differ significantly, which suggests that the bone marrow (BM) immune microenvironment may also play an important role. In recent years, several studies have shown that peripheral blood monocytes play an important role in promoting MPN. However, to date, the role of BM monocytes/macrophages in MPN and their transcriptomic alterations remain incompletely understood. The purpose of this study was to clarify the role of BM monocytes/macrophages in MPN patients with the JAK2^V617F mutation. MPN patients with the JAK2^V617F mutation were enrolled in this study. We investigated the roles of monocytes/macrophages in the BM of MPN patients, using flow cytometry, monocyte/macrophage enrichment sorting, cytospins and Giemsa-Wright staining, and RNA-seq. Pearson correlation coefficient analysis was also used to detect the correlation between BM monocytes/macrophages and the MPN phenotype. In the present study, the proportion of CD163^+ monocytes/macrophages increased significantly in all three subtypes of MPN. Interestingly, the percentages of CD163^+ monocytes/macrophages are positively correlated with HGB in PV patients and PLT in ET patients. In contrast, the percentages of CD163^+ monocytes/macrophages are negatively correlated with HGB and PLT in PMF patients. It was also found that CD14^+CD16^+ monocytes/macrophages increased and correlated with MPN clinical phenotypes. RNA-seq analyses demonstrated that the transcriptional expressions of monocytes/macrophages in MPN patients are relatively distinct. Gene expression profiles of BM monocytes/macrophages suggest a specialized function in support of megakaryopoiesis in ET patients. In contrast, BM monocytes/macrophages yielded a heterogeneous status in the support or inhibition of erythropoiesis. Significantly, BM monocytes/macrophages shaped an inflammatory microenvironment, which, in turn, promotes myelofibrosis. Thus, we characterized the roles of increased monocytes/macrophages in the occurrence and progression of MPNs. Our findings of the comprehensive transcriptomic characterization of BM monocytes/macrophages provide important resources to serve as a basis for future studies and future targets for the treatment of MPN patients.
Aims Growing evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial in controlling how diabetic retinopathy (DR) develops. We intend to mine miRNAs with diagnostic and predictive value for DR and to investigate new drug therapeutic targets. Methods After performing a differential analysis on the miRNA and mRNA datasets for DR and neovascularization (NEO), miRNA-mRNA networks were created. Combine the results of enrichment analysis, Protein–Protein Interaction Networks (PPI), and Cytoscape to identify key miRNAs. DrugBank was used to find drugs that interacted with transcription factors (TF) predicted by TransmiR. Finally, whole blood and clinical data were collected from 58 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and RT-qPCR, logistic analysis, and ROC were used to verify the value of key miRNAs. Results Differential analysis indicated the presence of genes and miRNAs that co-regulate DR and NEO. Enrichment analysis showed that key genes are inextricably linked to neovascularization. Combining the results of PPI and Cytoscape identified four key miRNAs, namely hsa-mir-(4328, 4422, 548z and -628-5p). RT-qPCR, logistic, and ROC results showed that decreased expression levels of hsa-mir-(4328, 4422, 548z and -628-5p) signal the risk of evolution to DR in T2DM patients. Finally, we constructed a TF-miRNA network to find the 15 TFs and the 35 drugs that interact with these TFs. Conclusion hsa-mir-(4328, 4422, 548z and -628-5p) in whole blood are protective factors for DR as novel biomarkers for diagnosis and prediction. In addition, our research provides new drug directions for the treatment of DR, such as Diosmin, Atorvastatin, and so on.
Purpose The mechanism of methylation of HPV CpG sites in the occurrence and prognosis of cervical carcinogenesis remains unclear. We investigated the effects of demethylation of the CpG sites of E2 and E6, essential genes of HPV16 integration, on cervical cancer cell expression, integration, and proliferation. Materials and Methods HPV16-positive (Caski) cells were treated with different concentrations of the demethylation compound 5-aza-dc (0, 5, 10, 20 μmol/l) in vitro. After the intervention, the methylation statuses of HPV16 E2 and E6 were detected by TBS, the expression levels of E2 and E6 mRNA and protein were detected by real-time PCR and western blot, cell proliferation activity was detected by CCK8, and cell cycle and apoptosis were determined by FCM. GraphPad Prism version 8.4.2 and R version 4.2.3 were used for relevant data analyses. Results The methylation levels of HPV16 E2 and E6 CpG sites decreased gradually with increasing 5-aza-dc intervention concentrations. With decreasing E2 and E6 methylation rates, E2 expression increased, the E2/E6 ratio increased, E6 expression decreased, and the growth inhibition rate of Caski cells increased. E2 and E6 expression were negatively and positively correlated with their degrees of methylation respectively, while the E2/E6 mRNA to protein ratio was negatively correlated with the methylation degrees of E2 and E6. Conclusion Demethylation can be used as a prospective treatment to affect HPV expression and persistent infection, providing a new theoretical basis for the clinical treatment of viral infections.
Huntington’s disease (HD) is a disease characterized by the progressive degeneration of nerve cells in the brain. DNA damage has been implicated in many neurological disorders; however, the association between this damage and the impaired signaling related to neurodegeneration is still unclear. The transcription factor c-AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) has a relevant role in the neuronal plasticity process regulating the expression of several genes, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Here we analyzed the direct link between DNA damage and the expression of genes involved in neuronal plasticity. The study was performed in model cell lines STHdhQ7 (wild type) and STHdhQ111 (HD model). Treatment with Etoposide (Eto) was used to induce double-strand breaks (DSBs) to evaluate the DNA damage response (DDR) and the expression of synaptic plasticity genes. Eto treatment induced phosphorylation of ATM (p-ATM) and H2AX (γH2AX), markers of DDR, in both cell lines. Interestingly, upon DNA damage, STHdhQ7 cells showed increased expression of activity-regulated cytoskeleton associated protein (Arc) and BDNF when compared to the HD cell line model. Additionally, Eto induced CREB activation with a differential localization of its co-activators in the cell types analyzed. These results suggest that DSBs impact differentially the gene expression patterns of plasticity genes in the normal cell line versus the HD model. This effect is mediated by the impaired localization of CREB-binding protein (CBP) and histone acetylation in the HD model. Our results highlight the role of epigenetics and DNA repair on HD and therefore we suggest that future studies should explore in depth the epigenetic landscape on neuronal pathologies with the goal to further understand molecular mechanisms and pinpoint therapeutic targets.
The circadian rhythm disorder and abnormal expression of rhythm genes are related to many diseases, especially cancer. Rhythm gene NFIL3 is involved in energy metabolism and immune cell differentiation, and its aberrant expression is associated with metabolic diseases and inflammation. Previously, numerous studies have shown that aberrant NFIL3 expression is associated with tumorigenesis, progression, and chemotherapy resistance. For instance, NFIL3 performs as a nuclear transcription factor, impacts cell proliferation, represses apoptosis, and promotes cancer cell invasion and metastasis by regulating the transcription of target genes. In addition, NFIL3 expressed in cancer cells influences the type and proportion of infiltrated immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. Increased expression of NFIL3 induces the chemotherapy and immunotherapy resistance in cancer. In this review, we summarized the pathological functions of NFIL3 in tumorigenesis, cancer development, and treatment. The rhythm gene NFIL3 can be used as a promising target in cancer therapy in the future.
Tubulins are the highly conserved subunit of microtubules which involve in various fundamental functions including brain development. Microtubules help in neuronal proliferation, migration, differentiation, cargo transport along the axons, synapse formation, and many more. Tubulin gene family consisting of multiple isotypes, their differential expression and varied post translational modifications create a whole new level of complexity and diversity in accomplishing manifold neuronal functions. The studies on the relation between tubulin genes and brain development opened a new avenue to understand the role of each tubulin isotype in neurodevelopment. Mutations in tubulin genes are reported to cause brain development defects especially cortical malformations, referred as tubulinopathies. There is an increased need to understand the molecular correlation between various tubulin mutations and the associated brain pathology. Recently, mutations in tubulin isotypes ( TUBA1A , TUBB , TUBB1 , TUBB2A , TUBB2B , TUBB3 , and TUBG1 ) have been linked to cause various neurodevelopmental defects like lissencephaly, microcephaly, cortical dysplasia, polymicrogyria, schizencephaly, subcortical band heterotopia, periventricular heterotopia, corpus callosum agenesis, and cerebellar hypoplasia. This review summarizes on the microtubule dynamics, their role in neurodevelopment, tubulin isotypes, post translational modifications, and the role of tubulin mutations in causing specific neurodevelopmental defects. A comprehensive list containing all the reported tubulin pathogenic variants associated with brain developmental defects has been prepared to give a bird’s eye view on the broad range of tubulin functions.
The OsFBT4 belongs to a small sub-class of rice F-box proteins called TLPs (Tubby-like proteins) containing the conserved N-terminal F-box domain and a C-terminal Tubby domain. These proteins have largely been implicated in both abiotic and biotic stress responses, besides developmental roles in plants. Here, we investigated the role of OsFBT4 in abiotic stress signalling. The OsFBT4 transcript was strongly upregulated in response to different abiotic stresses in rice, including exogenous ABA. When ectopically expressed, in Arabidopsis , under a constitutive CaMV 35S promoter, the overexpression (OE) caused hypersensitivity to most abiotic stresses, including ABA, during seed germination and early seedling growth. At the 5-day-old seedling growth stage, the OE conferred tolerance to all abiotic stresses. The OE lines displayed significant tolerance to salinity and water deficit at the mature growth stage. The stomatal size and density were seen to be altered in the OE lines, accompanied by hypersensitivity to ABA and hydrogen peroxide (H_2O_2) and a reduced water loss rate. Overexpression of OsFBT4 caused upregulation of several ABA-regulated/independent stress-responsive genes at more advanced stages of growth, showing wide and intricate roles played by OsFBT4 in stress signalling. The OsFBT4 showed interaction with several OSKs (Oryza SKP1 proteins) and localized to the plasma membrane (PM). The protein translocates to the nucleus, in response to oxidative and osmotic stresses, but failed to show transactivation activity in the yeast system. The OE lines also displayed morphological deviations from the wild-type (WT) plants, suggesting a role of the gene also in plant development.
Plants are frequently subjected to abiotic and biotic stress which causes major impediments in their growth and development. It is emerging that small guanosine triphosphatases (small GTPases), also known as monomeric GTP-binding proteins, assist plants in managing environmental stress. Small GTPases function as tightly regulated molecular switches that get activated with the aid of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and deactivated by the subsequent hydrolysis of GTP to guanosine diphosphate (GDP). All small GTPases except Rat sarcoma (Ras) are found in plants, including Ras-like in brain (Rab), Rho of plant (Rop), ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) and Ras-like nuclear (Ran). The members of small GTPases in plants interact with several downstream effectors to counteract the negative effects of environmental stress and disease-causing pathogens. In this review, we describe processes of stress alleviation by developing pathways involving several small GTPases and their associated proteins which are important for neutralizing fungal infections, stomatal regulation, and activation of abiotic stress-tolerant genes in plants. Previous reviews on small GTPases in plants were primarily focused on Rab GTPases, abiotic stress, and membrane trafficking, whereas this review seeks to improve our understanding of the role of all small GTPases in plants as well as their interactome in regulating mechanisms to combat abiotic and biotic stress. This review brings to the attention of scientists recent research on small GTPases so that they can employ genome editing tools to precisely engineer economically important plants through the overexpression/knock-out/knock-in of stress-related small GTPase genes.
Genetic and enzymatic potential of Neobacillus sedimentimangrovi has not been assembled to date. Here, we report a high-quality genome assembly of thermophilic bacterium Neobacillus sedimentimangrovi UE25 using Illumina Hi-seq 2500. The strain was isolated from a crocodile pond Manghopir, Karachi, Pakistan. QUAST quality parameters showed 37.75% GC content and exhibited the genome into 110 contigs, with a total size of 3,230,777 bases. Genome of N. sedimentimangrovi UE25 harbors phage mediated DNA through horizontal gene exchange from the phages, symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria. Most of the phage genome encodes for hypothetical proteins, protease, and phage assembly proteins. Gene clusters encoding the intrinsic resistance to glycopeptides, isoniazid, rifamycin, elfamycin, macrolide, aminoglycosides, tetracycline and fluoroquinolone were identified into the genome. Since, the strain has been reported for the production of many industrially important thermostable enzymes, therefore, the genomic data of thermostable enzymes might be helpful to employ this species in commercial sectors. Probing genes of multiple thermostable glycoside hydrolase enzymes especially xylanases of N. sedimentimangrovi UE25 showed genetic diversity among the genes and confer the industrial importance of this microorganism. Furthermore, the genome of N. sedimentimangrovi will greatly improve our understanding of its genetics and evolution.
Purpose Herein, we report the frequency and distribution of germline pathogenic variants (PVs) among females with breast cancer (BC) and at least one other non-BC who underwent multi-gene panel testing (MGPT). Among females with PVs diagnosed first with BC or ovarian cancer (OC), we sought to enumerate the frequency of subsequent PV-associated cancers. Methods Females with BC and cancer of ≥ 1 other site (multiple primary cancers, MPC) who underwent MGPT through Ambry Genetics from March 2012 to December 2016 were included if they had testing of at least 21 genes of interest ( ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDH1, CHEK2, EPCAM, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, MUTYH, NBN, NF1, PALB2, PMS2, PTEN, RAD51C, RAD51D, STK11, and TP53 ) . Phenotypic data were abstracted from test requisition forms and clinical notes. Results Of 6,617 evaluable patients, most were White (70.8%) and median age at first cancer, second cancer, and MGPT was 49 (interquartile range [IQR]: 18), 59 (IQR: 16), and 63 (IQR: 16) years, respectively. PVs were found among 14.1% (932/6617) of the overall cohort and in 16.4% (440/2687) of females who were diagnosed first with BC. Among those, 55.2% (243/440) had an actionable PV associated with a subsequent cancer diagnosis including 150 OCs. Of the 2443 females with breast and ovarian cancer, few ( n  = 97, 9.5%) were diagnosed first with OC, limiting our analysis. Conclusions Females with MPC, including BC, have a high frequency of germline PVs (14.1%). These data delineate the opportunities for intercepting subsequent cancers associated with genetic risk among females diagnosed first with BC.
Global warming has a strong impact on the polar regions, in particular, the Antarctic Peninsula and nearby islands. Methane (CH_4) is a major factor in climate change and mitigation of CH_4 emissions can be accomplished through microbial oxidation by methanotrophic bacteria. Understanding this biological process is crucial given the shortage of research carried out in this geographical area. The aim of this study was to characterise psychrophilic enrichment cultures of aerobic methanotrophs obtained from lake sediments of the Fildes Peninsula (King George Island, South Shetland Islands) and revealing the distribution of the genus Methylobacter in different lake sediments of the peninsula. Four stable methanotrophic enrichment cultures were obtained and analysed by metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). The phylogeny of methanotroph MAGs recovered from these enrichment cultures based on the 16S rRNA gene showed that K-2018 MAG008 and D1-2020 MAG004^Ts clustered within the Methylobacter clade 2, with high similarity to Methylobacter tundripaludum SV96^T (97.88 and 98.56% respectively). However, the average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values with M. tundripaludum were < 95% (84.8 and 85.0%, respectively) and < 70% (30.2 and 30.3%, respectively), suggesting that they represent a putative novel species for which the name ‘ Ca. Methylobacter titanis’ is proposed. This is the first species of clade 2 of the genus Methylobacter obtained from Antarctica. The bacterial diversity assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of 21 samples of different lakes (water column and sediments) revealed 54 ASVs associated with methanotrophs and the genus Methylobacter as the most abundant. These results suggest that aerobic methanotrophs belonging to the Methylobacter clade 2 would be the main responsible for CH_4 oxidation in these sediments.
Abstract The role of non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) in the early phase of acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury (AILI) remains unclear. Therefore, single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed to explore the heterogeneity and immune network of NPCs in the livers of mice with AILI. Mice were challenged with saline, 300 mg/kg APAP, or 750 mg/kg APAP ( n  = 3 for each group). After 3 h, the liver samples were collected, digested, and subjected to scRNA-seq. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were performed to confirm the expression of Makorin ring finger protein 1 (Mkrn1). We identified 14 distinct cell subtypes among the 120,599 cells. A variety of NPCs were involved, even in the early stages of AILI, indicating highly heterogeneous transcriptome dynamics. Cholangiocyte cluster 3, which had high deleted in malignant brain tumors 1 (Dmbt1) expression, was found to perform drug metabolism and detoxification functions. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells exhibited fenestrae loss and angiogenesis. Macrophage cluster 1 displayed a M1 polarization phenotype, whereas cluster 3 tended to exhibit M2 polarization. Kupffer cells (KCs) exhibited pro-inflammatory effects due to the high expression of Cxcl2. qRT-PCR and western blotting verified that the LIFR-OSM axis might promote the activation of MAPK signaling pathway in RAW264.7 macrophages. Mkrn1 was highly expressed in the liver macrophages of AILI mice and AILI patients. Interaction patterns between macrophages/KCs and other NPCs were complex and diverse. NPCs were highly heterogeneous and were involved in the immune network during the early phase of AILI. In addition, we propose that Mkrn1 may serve as a potential biomarker of AILI.
Dental plaque bacteria produce high concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), as bacterial metabolites. SCFA-treated gingival epithelial cells undergo cell death. Our previous reports demonstrated that butyrate-induced cell death depends on autophagy and reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the precise mechanisms underlying SCFA-induced gingival epithelial cell death is poorly understood. Butyrate is a strong histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. Therefore, we determined the involvement of HDAC inhibitory activity in SCFA-induced gingival epithelial cells. Ca9-22 cells were used as an in vitro counterpart of gingival epithelial cells. Ca9-22 cells were treated with HDAC inhibitors in the presence or absence of C646, a P300 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitor, and compared the number of dead cells, which are measured using SYTOX Green dye. Acetylation levels of histone H3 were examined using western blotting. Changes in transcriptomes during the butyrate and C646 treatment were examined using RNA sequencing analysis. The butyrate or propionate-treatment of Ca9-22 cells induced acetylation of histone H3, while the C646 treatment strongly reduced the elevated acetylation levels. Accordingly, butyrate or propionate-induced cell death was inhibited by the C646 treatment. Similar results were obtained when other HDAC inhibitors were used. Whole transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression of numerous genes was altered by butyrate-induced histone acetylation. Moreover, some autophagy and ROS-related genes found in the altered genes might induce cell death. This study suggests the need for HDAC-inhibitory activity of bacterial metabolites to induce cell death, and the effects might enhance autophagy and ROS production.
Intellectual disability (ID) is an early onset impairment in cognitive functioning and adaptive behavior, affecting approximately 1% of the population worldwide. Extreme skewing of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) can be associated with ID phenotypes caused by pathogenic variants in the X chromosome. We analyzed the XCI pattern in blood samples of 194 women with idiopathic ID, using the androgen receptor gene ( AR ) methylation assay. Among the 136 patients who were informative, 11 (8%) presented with extreme or total XCI skewing (≥ 90%), which was significantly higher than expected by chance. Whole-exome data obtained from these 11 patients revealed the presence of dominant pathogenic variants in eight of them, all sporadic cases, resulting in a molecular diagnostic rate of 73% (8/11 patients). All variants were mapped to ID-related genes with dominant phenotypes: four variants in the X-linked genes DDX3X (an XCI escape gene; two cases), WDR45, and PDHA1 , and four variants in the autosomal genes KCNB1, CTNNB1, YY1 , and ANKRD11 . Three of the autosomal genes had no obvious correlation with the observed XCI skewing. However, YY1 is a known transcriptional repressor that acts in the binding of the XIST long noncoding RNA on the inactive X chromosome, providing a mechanistic link between the pathogenic variant and the detected skewed XCI in the carrier. These data confirm that extreme XCI skewing in females with ID is highly indicative of causative X-linked pathogenic variants, and point to the possibility of identifying causative variants in autosomal genes with a XCI role.
Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) is a virus that already caused great losses in citrus producing regions. The cell wall of plant cells plays an important role in the defence response to viruses. Following several studies indicating that cell wall enzyme transcripts of callose synthase 7 ( c alS7 ) and xyloglucan endotransglucosylase 9 ( xth9 ) are modified during a viral infection, transcript expression of calS7 isoform x5 ( c alS7 x 5 ) and xth9  was evaluated over time in Citrus  ×  sinensis ‘Valencia Late’ (VL) and Citrus  ×  clementina ‘Fina’ (CL), infected with the severe CTV isolate T318A, by quantitative (q) PCR. qPCR analysis of healthy and CTV infected citrus was performed at 15 days, 10 months and at 31 months post-inoculation (dpi/mpi), respectively. The CTV titer, evaluated at the three time-points by qPCR, increased over time in bark tissues, with VL plants exhibiting a titer about 5 times higher than CL 31 mpi. CTV infection did not cause significant changes in calS7 x 5 gene expression over time in both citrus cultivars. However, CTV infection was associated with significant up-regulation of xth9 in VL compared to controls 31 mpi. This study highlights that CTV infection can affect the expression of specific cell wall-associated genes over time and that this influence was distinct for VL and CL. This study provides further insight into the CTV-citrus host interaction, with the long-term response of VL to a severe CTV isolate involving a high expression of the xth9 gene.
In the field of bioinformatics, the classification of tumors is a difficult and time-consuming task. When diagnosing cancer, gene expression levels are typically one of the most useful tools. However, the biological noise present in microarray data leads to unsatisfactory precision and accuracy. The utilization of thousands of genes in the process of diagnosing tumors is an important task. The two levels of feature selection have been proposed in order to determine the genes that are the most informative to diagnose cancer. Using three different statistical methods, the first level of selection reveals the prognostic genes. In the second level, the differential evolution algorithm considers the prognostic genes that were obtained from statistical measures as initial members to identify the most relevant features. The scaling factor in the modified differential evolution algorithm was made to vary in a dynamic manner in order to evolve the mutant member of the population. The proposed model is a hybrid of statistical approach and evolutionary computation with modified differential evolution algorithm that identifies the candidate genes from thousands of genes from gene expression data. The findings obtained through this hybrid approach upon testing five gene expression datasets provide evidence that it has outperformed when compared to the existing systems for DLBCL outcome, prostate outcome, prostate, and colon tumor datasets with improved classification accuracies of 14%, 4%, 0.62%, and 0.13%, respectively.
Breeding program to improve economically important growth traits in striped catfish ( Pangasianodon hypophthalmus ) requires effective molecular markers. This study was conducted to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Insulin-like Growth Factor-Binding Protein 7 ( IGFBP7 ) gene which plays multiple roles in regulating growth, energy metabolism and development. The association between SNPs in IGFBP7 gene and growth traits in striped catfish was analyzed in order to uncover the SNPs that have potential to be valuable markers for improving growth traits. Firstly, fragments of IGFBP7 gene from ten fast-growing fish and ten slow-growing fish were sequenced in order to discover SNPs. After filtering the detected SNPs, an intronic SNP (2060A > G) and two non-synonymous SNPs (344 T > C and 4559C > A) causing Leu78Pro and Leu189Met in protein, respectively, were subjected to further validated by individual genotyping in 70 fast-growing fish and 70 slow-growing fish using single base extension method. Our results showed that two SNPs (2060A > G and 4559 C > A (p. Leu189Met)) were significantly associated with the growth in P. hypophthalmus ( p  < 0.001), thus being candidate SNP markers for the growth traits of this fish. Moreover, linkage disequilibrium and association analysis with growth traits of haplotypes generated from the 3 filtered SNPs (344 T > C, 2060 A > G and 4559 C > A) were examined. These revealed that the non-coding SNP locus (2060A > G) had higher genetic diversity at which the G allele was predominant over the A allele in the fast-growing fish. Furthermore, the results of qPCR showed that expression of IGFBP7 gene with genotype GG (at locus 2060) in fast-growing group was significantly higher than that with genotype AA in slow-growing group ( p  < 0.05). Our study provides insights into the genetic variants of IGFBP7 gene and useful data source for development molecular marker for growth traits in breeding of the striped catfish.
Purpose Young premenopausal women develop breast cancer (BC) within 5–10 years of the last childbirth, known as post-partum breast cancers (PPBC), often present with aggressive disease. The exact mechanisms that lead to poor prognosis in these patients are largely unknown. Methods We have evaluated the association of clinical and reproductive factors with BC in a cohort of women ≤ 45 years ( N  = 155) with long-term follow-up. Based on duration since last childbirth (LCB), grouped patients into PPBC1 (LCB ≤ 5 years), PPBC2 (LCB between 6 and 10 years), PPBC3 (LCB > 10 years), and NPBC (age-matched nulliparous BC patients). We compared disease-free survival and hazard associated with recurrence/metastasis between the groups. RNA sequencing of tumor samples was performed from three parous groups ( n  = 10), and transcriptomic data were analyzed for differentially expressed genes and altered pathways. Results Women in the PPBC1 group had an early menarche and late age at first and last childbirth compared to other groups. Survival analysis within lymph node-positive tumors showed that PPBC1 tumors had a worse prognosis than PPBC2 and NPBC tumors ( p  = 0.015 and p  = 0.026, respectively). Clustering of the differentially expressed genes between the groups showed distinct expression in early PPBC (E-PPBC) tumors. Pathway analysis revealed upregulation of invasive-related pathways along with T cell exhaustion, extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in E-PPBC tumors. Conclusion Early PPBC is a unique subtype with aggressive clinical features and distinct biology. Further research is needed to accurately project the risk of recurrence and optimal treatment strategies in these young patients.
B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (BCL11A) is highly expressed in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), blocks cell differentiation, and inhibits cell apoptosis. However, little is known about BCL11A in the proliferation, invasion, and migration of B-NHL cells. Here, we found increased expression of BCL11A in B-NHL patients and cell lines. Knockdown of BCL11A suppressed the proliferation, invasion, and migration of B-NHL cells in vitro and reduced tumor growth in vivo. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and KEGG pathway analysis demonstrated that BCL11A-targeted genes were significantly enriched in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, focal adhesion, and extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction (including COL4A1, COL4A2, FN1, SPP1), and SPP1 was the most significantly downregulated gene. qRT‒PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry revealed that silencing BCL11A reduced the expression level of SPP1 in Raji cells. Our study suggested that high level of BCL11A may promote B-NHL proliferation, invasion, and migration, and the BCL11A-SPP1 regulatory axis may play an important role in Burkitt’s lymphoma.
The degree of endocarp lignification in walnut affects its yield, disease resistance, and seed kernel quality. However, its molecular mechanisms have been less studied. Gibberellin A3 (GA_3) is widely used as a common chemical regulator in agriculture to regulate lignin synthesis. Our results indicate that 100 mg/L GA_3 accelerated endocarp lignification in the early stages of shell hardenings of “Chandler” walnut. Transcriptome analysis of GA_3-treated walnut revealed that walnut MYBs are primarily involved in the regulation of GA_3-induced endocarp lignification. Based on the walnut genome database, we identified 207 MYB family members. By co-expression analysis of the transcriptome, we constructed the regulatory network in the endocarp lignification of walnut and screened the hub gene JrMYB180 , whose expression was greatly induced by exogenous GA_3. The function of JrMYB180 in the GA_3-induced lignin biosynthesis in walnut endocarp was further validated by transient over-expression, subcellular localization, and qRT-PCR. This study provides knowledge for studying the development of walnut endocarp and the improvement of walnut varieties.
Laccases are multicopper-containing enzymes that have the ability to oxidize a wide variety of substrates with a single electron transfer reaction. These are environmentally benign versatile biocatalysts that have gained great interest in the biotechnological community since they utilize molecular oxygen as the last electron acceptor and only produce water as a byproduct. This family of enzymes has been widely used in a broad variety of applications, ranging from food additives and beverage processing to biological diagnostics and even as crosslinking agents in the furniture construction and manufacture of biofuels. Considering the benefits of enzyme immobilization, there has been a dramatic increase in applying immobilized laccases in recent years. Despite the impressive biotechnological promise, the use of laccases in the real world is still constrained by cost–benefit analysis, particularly in terms of practically large-scale production. The enzyme industry is booming research on laccase production, and use neglects to include the economic impact of the operations. Because of their ability to metabolize complex xenobiotics, they are also useful biocatalysts in enzymatic bioremediation processes, such as wastewater treatment. This study discusses the most important and recent breakthroughs in the biocatalytic attributes, sources, and exploitation of laccases in biotechnology for a sustainable industry. Graphical Abstract 
Despite the nutritional and economic importance of carotenoids and their products, regulation of carotenoid content in leaves remains to be fully elucidated. Recent findings indicate that carotenoid content are determined, at least in part, by the activity of carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1 (CCD1). This study examined whether NtCCD1 affects leaf carotenoids in the model plant Nicotiana tabacum . Three NtCCD1s, NtCCD1a, NtCCD1b, and NtCCD1c, were investigated including their phylogenetic relationships, conserved motifs, and exon-intron architecture. Of the three transcripts, NtCCD1c exhibited the highest expression level in various tissue as determined by real-time PCR. Confocal microscopy indicated that all NtCCD1s are located in the cytoplasm. The enzymatic activity of the NtCCD1c protein was also studied by co-expressing NtCCD1c in Escherichia coli engineered to accumulate β-carotene or lycopene. SPME-GC-MS indicated that NtCCD1c cleaves β-carotene and lycopene specifically at the 9–10/9′-10′ site to produce β-ionone and pseudoionone, respectively. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of NbCCD1 increased carotenoid contents including β-carotene, α-carotene, zeaxanthin, phytoene, lutein, violaxanthin, neoxanthin, and β-cryptoxanthin, along with a decline in reactive oxygen species (ROS). RNA-seq of silenced plants suppressed NbCCD1 but enhanced expression of essential genes encoding antioxidant enzymes including NtGST, NtCuZnSOD, NtAAO, and NtPOD, along with a decrease in expression of genes related to carbon fixation such as NtRCA1, NtRCA2, and NtRBCS. These observations suggest that NtCCD1 is a negative regulator of carotenoid content and plays an essential role in the regulation of ROS levels in tobacco leaves.
Using effective genes to improve crop stress tolerance through genetic engineering is an important way to stabilize crop yield and quality across complex climatic environments. Integrin-like AT14A, as a continuum of the cell wall–plasma membrane–cytoskeleton, functions in the regulation of cell wall synthesis, signal transduction, and the response to stress. In this study, AT14A was overexpressed in Solanum lycopersicum L. In transgenic plants, both chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate increased. Physiological experiments suggested that the proline content and antioxidant enzyme (superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase) activities of the transgenic line were significantly higher than those of wild-type plants under stress, which contributed to the enhanced water retention capacity and free radical scavenging ability of the transgenic line. Transcriptome analysis revealed that AT14A enhanced drought tolerance by regulating waxy cuticle synthesis genes, such as 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 20 ( KCS20 ), non-specific lipid-transfer protein 2 ( LTP2 ), antioxidant enzyme system genes peroxidase 42-like ( PER42 ), and dehydroascorbate reductase ( DHAR2 ). AT14A regulates expression of Protein phosphatase 2 C 51 ( PP2C 51 ) and ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE 5 ( ABI5 ) to participate in ABA pathways to enhance drought tolerance. In conclusion, AT14A effectively improved photosynthesis and enhanced drought tolerance in S . lycopersicum .
Forensic molecular autopsies have emerged as a tool for medical examiners to establish the cause of death. It is particularly useful in sudden unexplained deaths where the cause of death cannot be determined with a regular medical autopsy. We provide the first study of exome data from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples (FFPE) paired with data from high-quality blood samples in forensic applications. The approach allows exploration of the potential to use FFPE samples for molecular autopsies and identify variants in extensive exome data. We leverage the high uniformity of the hybridization capture approach provided by Twist Bioscience to target the complete exome and sequence the libraries on a NextSeq 550. Our findings suggest that exome sequencing is feasible for 24 out of a total of 35 included FFPE samples. When successful, the coverage across the exome is comparatively high (> 90% covered to 20X) and uniform (fold80 below 1.5). Detailed variant comparisons for matched FFPE and blood samples show high concordance with few false variants (positive predictive value of 0.98 and a sensitivity of 0.97) with no distinct FFPE artefacts. Ultimately, we apply carefully constructed forensic gene panels in a stepwise manner to find genetic variants associated with the clinical phenotype and with relevance to the sudden unexplained death.
Anthracnose is an important plant disease often caused by Colletotrichum spp. Fungicide resistance is a major challenge in controlling anthracnose. The Fungicide Resistance Action Committee (FRAC) reports that Colletotrichum  species develop resistance against methyl benzimidazole carbamates (MBC), quinone-outside inhibitors (QoI), and demethylation inhibitors (DMI) fungicide classes. The high resistance of Colletotrichum species to MBC fungicides is attributed to the substitution of glutamic acid (E) with alanine (A) or lysine (K) in codon 198 of the nuclear β-tubulin ( TUB2 ) gene (E198A/K mutation). Meanwhile, moderate MBC resistance is attributed to the substitution of phenylalanine (F) with tyrosine (Y) in codon 200 of TUB2 (F200Y mutation). High QoI-resistance is associated with the substitution of glycine (G) with alanine (A) in codon 143 of the mitochondrial cytochrome b (CYTB ) gene (G143A mutation). On the other hand, moderate QoI resistance is attributed to the substitution of phenylalanine (F) with leucine (L) in codon 129 of CYTB (F129L mutation). In contrast to MBC- and QoI-resistance, which are associated with point mutations in the target genes, complex nucleotide mutations for DMI-resistance occur in the nuclear sterol 14α-demethylase ( CYP51 ) gene. Taken together, these mutations in nucleotide/codon sequences cause changes in the translated amino acid residues, resulting in altered structure of proteins targeted by fungicides, thus affecting fungicide binding and effectivity. The underlying molecular mechanisms of fungicide resistance caused by these mutations, including the other resistance mechanisms independent from genetic mutations, are also reviewed. The distribution and phylogeography of reported Colletotrichum species that exhibit fungicide resistance are also discussed.
Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is an umbrella term describing the neuropathology of a clinically, genetically and pathologically heterogeneous group of diseases, including frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Among the major FTLD pathological subgroups, FTLD with TDP-43 positive inclusions (FTLD-TDP) and FTLD with tau-positive inclusions (FTLD-tau) are the most common, representing about 90% of the cases. Although alterations in DNA methylation have been consistently associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, little is known for FTLD and its heterogeneous subgroups and subtypes. The main goal of this study was to investigate DNA methylation variation in FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau. We used frontal cortex genome-wide DNA methylation profiles from three FTLD cohorts (142 FTLD cases and 92 controls), generated using the Illumina 450K or EPIC microarrays. We performed epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) for each cohort followed by meta-analysis to identify shared differentially methylated loci across FTLD subgroups/subtypes. In addition, we used weighted gene correlation network analysis to identify co-methylation signatures associated with FTLD and other disease-related traits. Wherever possible, we also incorporated relevant gene/protein expression data. After accounting for a conservative Bonferroni multiple testing correction, the EWAS meta-analysis revealed two differentially methylated loci in FTLD, one annotated to OTUD4 (5’UTR-shore) and the other to NFATC1 (gene body-island) . Of these loci, OTUD4 showed consistent upregulation of mRNA and protein expression in FTLD. In addition, in the three independent co-methylation networks, OTUD4 -containing modules were enriched for EWAS meta-analysis top loci and were strongly associated with the FTLD status. These co-methylation modules were enriched for genes implicated in the ubiquitin system, RNA/stress granule formation and glutamatergic synaptic signalling. Altogether, our findings identified novel FTLD-associated loci, and support a role for DNA methylation as a mechanism involved in the dysregulation of biological processes relevant to FTLD, highlighting novel potential avenues for therapeutic development.
To transfer toxicological findings from model systems, e.g. animals, to humans, standardized safety factors are applied to account for intra-species and inter-species variabilities. An alternative approach would be to measure and model the actual compound-specific uncertainties. This biological concept assumes that all observed toxicities depend not only on the exposure situation (environment = E), but also on the genetic (G) background of the model (G  ×  E). As a quantitative discipline, toxicology needs to move beyond merely qualitative G  ×  E concepts. Research programs are required that determine the major biological variabilities affecting toxicity and categorize their relative weights and contributions. In a complementary approach, detailed case studies need to explore the role of genetic backgrounds in the adverse effects of defined chemicals. In addition, current understanding of the selection and propagation of adverse outcome pathways (AOP) in different biological environments is very limited. To improve understanding, a particular focus is required on modulatory and counter-regulatory steps. For quantitative approaches to address uncertainties, the concept of “genetic” influence needs a more precise definition. What is usually meant by this term in the context of G  ×  E are the protein functions encoded by the genes. Besides the g ene sequence, the regulation of the gene expression and function should also be accounted for. The widened concept of past and present “ g ene expression” influences is summarized here as G_ e . Also, the concept of “environment” needs some re-consideration in situations where exposure timing (E_ t ) is pivotal: prolonged or repeated exposure to the insult (chemical, physical, life style) affects G_ e . This implies that it changes the model system. The interaction of G_ e with E_ t might be denoted as G_ e  ×  E_ t . We provide here general explanations and specific examples for this concept and show how it could be applied in the context of New Approach Methodologies (NAM).
We aimed to understand the crosstalk between mismatch repair (MMR) and FA-BRCA pathway in primary bladder carcinoma (BlCa) samples as well as in chemotolerant cell line. We analysed the genetic alterations of MLH1 and MSH2 (MMR-related genes) and after that we correlated it with the nuclear translocation of FANCD2 protein. Next, we evaluated this crosstalk in T24 BlCa cell line in response to doxorubicin treatment. In primary BlCa tumors, infrequent genetic deletion (17–20%) but frequent promoter methylation (28–55%) of MLH1 and MSH2 was observed, where MLH1 was significantly ( p  < 0.05) more methylated among the early staged samples (NMIBC). However, MSH2 was significantly more altered among the NMIBC samples, signifying the importance of MMR pathway during the early pathogenesis of the disease. Furthermore, BlCa samples with underexpressed MLH1/MSH2 protein possessed cytoplasmic FANCD2 protein; encouraging that inefficiency of MMR proteins might restrict FANCD2 nuclear translocation. Next, we analysed publicly available data in GEO2R tool where we observed that in response to chemotherapeutic drugs, expression of MLH1, MSH2 and FANCD2 were diminishing. Validating this result in doxorubicin tolerant T24 cells, we found that expression of MLH1 and MSH2 was gradually decreased with increasing dose of doxorubicin. Interestingly, FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination (L-form) was also reduced in chemotolerant T24 cells. The crosstalk between MMR and FA-BRCA pathway was substantiated in the primary BlCa tumors. Further, in response to doxorubicin, this crosstalk was found to be hampered due to under-expression of MLH1 and MSH2 gene, thereby rendering chemotolerance.
Background Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have dramatically changed the landscape of cancer treatment. However, only a few patients respond to ICI treatment. Thus, uncovering clinically accessible ICI biomarkers would help identify which patients will respond well to ICI treatment. A comprehensive objective response rate (ORR) data of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy in pan-cancer would offer the original data to explore the new biomarkers for ICIs. Methods We systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase for clinical trials on July 1, 2021, limited to the years 2017–2021, from which we obtained studies centering around anti–PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy. Finally, 121 out of 3099 publications and 143 ORR data were included. All of the 31 tumor types/subtypes can be found in the TCGA database. The gene expression profiles and mutation data were downloaded from TCGA. A comprehensive genome-wide screening of ORR highly correlated mutations among 31 cancers was conducted by Pearson correlation analysis based on the TCGA database. Results According to the ORR, we classified 31 types of cancer into high, medium, and low response types. Further analysis uncovered that “high response” cancers had more T cell infiltration, more neoantigens, and less M2 macrophage infiltration. A panel of 28 biomarkers reviewed from recent articles were investigated with ORR. We also found the TMB as a traditional biomarker had a high correlation coefficient with ORR in pan-cancer, however, the correlation between ITH and ORR was low across pan-cancer. Moreover, we primarily identified 1044 ORR highly correlated mutations through a comprehensive screening of TCGA data, among which USH2A, ZFHX4 and PLCO mutations were found to be highly correlated to strengthened tumor immunogenicity and inflamed antitumor immunity, as well as improved outcomes for ICIs treatment among multiple immunotherapy cohorts. Conclusion Our study provides comprehensive data on ORR of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy across 31 tumor types/subtypes and an essential reference of ORR to explore new biomarkers. We also screened out a list of 1044 immune response related genes and we showed that USH2A, ZFHX4 and PLCO mutations may act as good biomarkers for predicting patient response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 ICIs.
Purpose Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly vascularized tumor, and angiogenesis plays an important role in its progression. However, the role of angiogenesis in cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains unclear. Methods We evaluated the associations of 35 angiogenesis-related genes (ARGs) with the clinicopathological features of 816 HCC patients. In addition, we assessed the associations between the ARGs and TME cell infiltration. A nomogram was constructed to determine the prognostic value of ARGs for HCC. The ARG score was used to distinguish angiogenic subtypes of HCC, and its usefulness for predicting the prognosis and treatment response of HCC patients was evaluated. Results We distinguished three ARG clusters differing in terms of TME cell infiltration, immune cell activation status, clinicopathological features, and clinical outcomes. There were significant associations of ARG expression with tumor immunity, the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), and transforming growth factor-β expression. An ARG score model was constructed to generate a risk score for each patient based on differentially expressed genes between clusters. Furthermore, a high ARG score was associated with high expression of CTLA-4 and PD-L1/PD-1, and a low Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion score, indicating the usefulness of the ARG score for selecting patients for immunotherapy. Considering the relationship between ARGs and tumor immunity, immunotherapy combined with vascular-targeted therapy may be the best treatment for HCC. Conclusions ARGs play an important role in TME diversity and complexity in HCC patients. The ARG score of HCC predicts TME invasion and can guide immunotherapy.
High polymorphism in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes plays an essential role in adaptive immune response among vertebrates through antigen recognition and presentation. For vulnerable Asiatic black bear, a lack of DQB gene sequences from continental populations hindered further genetic diversity analysis in a large geographical region. Here, we used PCR cloning and sequencing to characterize genetic diversity of DQB gene among different populations of the species. Trans-species polymorphism (TSP) and selective strength of DQB gene were assessed by sequence analysis in Ursidae. Forty-seven novel Urth-MHC haplotypes, including 32 putative functional alleles (PFA, Urth-DQB*33–Urth-DQB *64) and one presumed pseudogene (Urth-DQB*65), were identified in the population. Allelic frequency varied greatly (Urth-DQB*4601 had the highest value) and number of rare alleles was high (34.04%). This might suggest a risk of allele loss by inbreeding and genetic drift if the effective populations continue to be subdivided and decline without appropriate conservation strategies. In the southern continental population (captive animals), the total number of alleles and population-specific alleles were higher than those in the northern. This suggested the southern continental population was exposed to various pathogens and close conservation attention is required to keep the population safe. Based on values of Hd, π , and K , genetic diversity of the island population was lower when compared to continental populations. This could be explained by fewer pathogen communities in island populations, and confirmed the prediction that large majority of island populations would be less genetically diverse than their continental counterparts. No any allele including those ancestral alleles being similar among Ursidae species was shared between the continental and island populations. In phylogenetic analysis, DQB alleles did not show monophyletic for any single species and four alleles were shared among Ursidae. This pattern was TSP. The ratio ( ω  =  d _N / d _S) was significantly higher than unity on PBR codons (4.029). These features supported the influence of balancing selection of the DQB locus among continental populations and contributing to the genetic diversity of Urth-DQB. All codons under positive selection matched the PBR sites inferred by HLA-DQB using four testing methods. Pathogen-driven positive selection could be the other important mechanism to maintain the advantageous mutation for DQB alleles. This information will not only promote the understanding of MHC diversity and polymorphism in the Asiatic black bear but will also increase the implication of protecting vulnerable species in the wild and captive for the appropriate management and conservation initiatives.
Immunotherapy has greatly changed the status of cancer treatment, and many patients do not respond or develop acquired resistance. The related research is blocked by lacking of comprehensive resources for researchers to discovery and analysis signatures, then further exploring the mechanisms. Here, we first offered a benchmarking dataset of experimentally supported signatures of cancer immunotherapy by manually curated from published literature works and provided an overview. We then developed CiTSA ( http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/CiTSA/ ) which stores 878 entries of experimentally supported associations between 412 signatures such as genes, cells, and immunotherapy across 30 cancer types. CiTSA also provides flexible online tools to identify and visualize molecular/cell feature and interaction, to perform function, correlation, and survival analysis, and to execute cell clustering, cluster activity, and cell–cell communication analysis based on single cell and bulk datasets of cancer immunotherapy. In summary, we provided an overview of experimentally supported cancer immunotherapy signatures and developed CiTSA which is a comprehensive and high-quality resource and is helpful for understanding the mechanism of cancer immunity and immunotherapy, developing novel therapeutic targets and promoting precision immunotherapy for cancer.
Background Hirschsprung’s disease (HSCR) is one of the most common congenital digestive tract malformations and can cause stubborn constipation or gastrointestinal obstruction after birth, causing great physical and mental pain to patients and their families. Studies have shown that more than 20 genes are involved in HSCR, and most cases of HSCR are sporadic. However, the overall rate of familial recurrence in 4331 cases of HSCR is about 7.6%. Furthermore, familial HSCR patients show incomplete dominance. We still do not know the penetrance and genetic characteristics of these known risk genes due to the rarity of HSCR families. Methods To find published references, we used the title/abstract terms “Hirschsprung” and “familial” in the PubMed database and the MeSH terms “Hirschsprung” and “familial” in Web of Science. Finally, we summarized 129 HSCR families over the last 40 years. Results The male-to-female ratio and the percentage of short segment-HSCR in familial HSCR are much lower than in sporadic HSCR. The primary gene factors in the syndromic families are ret proto-oncogene ( RET ) and endothelin B receptor gene ( EDNRB ). Most families show incomplete dominance and are relevant to RET , and the RET mutation has 56% penetrance in familial HSCR. When one of the parents is a RET mutation carrier in an HSCR family, the offspring’s recurrence risk is 28%, and the incidence of the offspring does not depend on whether the parent suffers from HSCR. Conclusion Our findings will help HSCR patients obtain better genetic counseling, calculate the risk of recurrence, and provide new insights for future pedigree studies.
Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified over 100 colorectal cancer (CRC) risk loci, an understanding of causal genes or risk variants and their biological functions in these loci remain unclear. Recently, genomic loci 10q26.12 with lead SNP rs1665650 was identified as an essential CRC risk loci of Asian populations. However, the functional mechanism of this region has not been fully clarified. Here, we applied an RNA interfering-based on-chip approach to screen for the genes essential for cell proliferation in the CRC risk loci 10q26.12. Notably, HSPA12A had the most significant effect among the identified genes and functioned as a crucial oncogene facilitating cell proliferation. Moreover, we conducted an integrative fine-mapping analysis to identify putative casual variants and further explored their association with CRC risk in a large-scale Chinese population consisting of 4054 cases and 4054 controls and also independently validated in 5208 cases and 20,832 controls from the UK biobank cohort. We identified a risk SNP rs7093835 in the intron of HSPA12A that was significantly associated with an increased risk of CRC (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.08–1.41, P  = 1.92 × 10^–3). Mechanistically, the risk variant could facilitate an enhancer–promoter interaction mediated by the transcriptional factor (TF) GRHL1 and ultimately upregulate HSPA12A expression, which provides functional evidence to support our population findings. Collectively, our study reveals the important role of HSPA12A in CRC development and illustrates a novel enhancer–promoter interaction module between HSPA12A and its regulatory elements rs7093835, providing new insights into the etiology of CRC.
Valsa canker, caused by the necrotrophic fungus Valsa species, is one of the most destructive diseases that threatens the development of apple and pear production. The discovery of resistance genes is helpful for resistance breeding and for carrying out control measures. In this study, we identified a LysM-Containing Receptor Protein 1 ( PbeLYP1 ) in the Valsa -resistant rootstock Pyrus betulifolia . Expression assays revealed that PbeLYP1 was induced by both Valsa pyri ( Vp ) and Vp metabolism ( Vp M). The transient expression on pear fruit and stably transformed suspension cells confirmed the positive role of PbeLYP1 in resistance to Valsa canker. Key genes related to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling were significantly induced in PbeLYP1 -overexpressing cell lines. In conclusion, PbeLYP1 positively regulates Valsa canker resistance,which is associated with the induction of ROS and JA signaling.
A hydroponic experiment was used to study the effects of different nitrogen supply levels [1) control: 0.3835 mmol/L (labelled 1/20 N for CK); 2) 1/5 N (1.534 mmol/L); 3) 1 N (7.67 mmol/L); 4) 2 N (15.34 mmol/L); 5) 3 N (23.01 mmol/L)] on tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum L.) leaf carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism. The results showed that after 9 days of treatment, the contents of starch and sucrose in tomato leaves increased first and then decreased with the increase of nitrogen concentration, and reached the highest value in 1 N treatment. With the increase of nitrogen concentration, the contents of glucose and fructose decreased. The enzymes related to nitrogen metabolism (Glutamate dehydrogenase) tended to increase and then decrease with increasing nitrogen concentration, with the highest values occurring in the medium nitrogen (1 N) treatment group, while the enzyme activity of NADH- Glutamate synthase showed the opposite trend, with the lowest values occurring in the 2 N treatment group. A total of 6383 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the leaf transcriptome analysis, which are involved in the aerobic glycolysis tricarboxylic acid cycle, amino acid biosynthesis and nitrogen metabolism pathways, and related transcriptional regulatory pathways were constructed. Thus, this study reveals the mechanisms of tomato leaf carbon and nitrogen metabolism in response to nitrogen supply levels at the physiological, biochemical and transcriptional regulatory levels, providing valuable insights for further understanding nitrogen metabolism mechanisms and guiding nitrogen utilization in tomato.
The age determination of individuals, especially minors, is critical in forensic research. In forensic practice, dental age estimation is one of the most commonly used methods for determining age as teeth are easy to preserve and relatively resistant to environmental factors. Tooth development is affected and regulated by genetic factors; however, these are not incorporated into current commonly used tooth age inference methods, leading to unreliable results. Here, we established a Demirjian and a Cameriere tooth age estimation-based methods suitable for use in children in southern China. By using the difference between the inferred age and the actual age (MD) as the phenotype, we identified 65 and 49 SNPs related to tooth age estimation from 743,722 loci among 171 children in southern China through a genome-wide association analysis ( p <0.0001). We also conducted a genome-wide association study on dental development stage (DD) using the Demirjian tooth age estimation method and screened two sets of SNP sites (52 and 26) based on whether age difference was considered. The gene function enrichment analysis of these SNPs found that they were related to bone development and mineralization. Although SNP sites screened based on MD seem to improve the accuracy of tooth age estimation, there is little correlation between these SNPs and an individual’s Demirjian morphological stage. In conclusion, we found that individual genotypes can affect tooth age estimation, and based on different phenotypic analysis models, we have identified some novel SNP sites related to tooth age inference and Demirjian’s tooth development stage. These studies provide a reference for subsequent phenotypic selection based on tooth age inference analysis, and the results could possibly be used in the future to make forensic age estimation more accurate.
Neurological diseases can be broadly divided according to causal factors into circulatory system disorders leading to ischemic stroke; degeneration of the nerve cells leading to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s (AD) and Parkinson’s (PD) diseases, and immune system disorders; bioelectric activity (epileptic) problems; and genetically determined conditions as well as viral and bacterial infections developing inflammation. Regardless of the cause of neurological diseases, they are usually accompanied by disturbances of the central energy in a completely unexplained mechanism. The brain makes up only 2% of the human body’s weight; however, while working, it uses as much as 20% of the energy obtained by the body. The energy requirements of the brain are very high, and regulatory mechanisms in the brain operate to ensure adequate neuronal activity. Therefore, an understanding of neuroenergetics is rapidly evolving from a “neurocentric” view to a more integrated picture involving cooperativity between structural and molecular factors in the central nervous system. This article reviewed selected molecular biomarkers of oxidative stress and energy metabolism disorders such as homocysteine, DNA damage such as 8-oxo2dG, genetic variants, and antioxidants such as glutathione in selected neurological diseases including ischemic stroke, AD, PD, and epilepsy. This review summarizes our and others’ recent research on oxidative stress in neurological disorders. In the future, the diagnosis and treatment of neurological diseases may be substantially improved by identifying specific early markers of metabolic and energy disorders.
Sinopodophyllum hexandrum (Royle) T. S. Ying, an important source of podophyllotoxin (PTOX), has become a rare and endangered plant because of over-harvesting. Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is the main way of seedling rapid propagation and germplasm enhancement, but the regeneration of S. hexandrum has not been well established, and the PTOX biosynthesis abilities at different SE stages remain unclear. Therefore, it is extremely important to elucidate the SE mechanism of S. hexandrum and clarify the biosynthesis variation of PTOX. In this study, the transcriptomes of S. hexandrum at different SE stages were sequenced, the contents of PTOX and 4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin were assayed, and the transcript expression patterns were validated by qRT-PCR. The results revealed that plant hormone (such as auxins, abscisic acid, zeatin, and gibberellins) related pathways were significantly enriched among different SE stages, indicating these plant hormones play important roles in SE of S. hexandrum ; the expression levels of a series of PTOX biosynthesis related genes as well as PTOX and 4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin contents were much higher in embryogenic callus stage than in the other stages, suggesting embryogenic callus stage has the best PTOX biosynthesis ability among different SE stages. This study will contribute to germplasm conservation and fast propagation of S. hexandrum , and facilitate the production of PTOX.
Low light (LL) stress during the grain-filling stage acutely impairs the quality and quantity of starch accumulation in rice grains. Here, we observed that LL-induced poor starch biosynthesis is modulated by auxin homeostasis, which regulates the activities of major carbohydrate metabolism enzymes such as starch synthase (SS) and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) in rice. Further, during the grain-filling period under LL, the starch/sucrose ratio increased in leaves but significantly decreased in the developing spikelets. This suggests poor sucrose biosynthesis in leaves and starch in the grains of the rice under LL. A lower grain starch was found to be correlated with the depleted AGPase and SS activities in the developing rice grains under LL. Further, under LL, the endogenous auxin (IAA) level in the spikelets was found to be synchronized with the expression of a heteromeric G protein gene, RGB1. Interestingly, under LL, the expression of OsYUC11 was significantly downregulated, which subsequently resulted in reduced IAA in the developing rice spikelets, followed by poor activation of grain-filling enzymes. This resulted in lowered grain starch accumulation, grain weight, panicle number, spikelet fertility, and eventually grain yield, which was notably higher in the LL-susceptible (GR4, IR8) than in the LL-tolerant (Purnendu, Swarnaprabha) rice genotypes. Therefore, we hypothesize that depletion in auxin biosynthesis under LL stress is associated with the downregulation of RBG1 , which discourages the expression and activities of grain-filling enzymes, resulting in lower starch production, panicle formation, and grain yield in rice.
Early childhood obesity is a real public health problem worldwide. Identifying the etiologies, especially treatable and preventable causes, can direct health professionals toward proper management. Measurement of serum leptin levels is helpful in the diagnosis of congenital leptin and leptin receptor deficiencies which are considered important rare causes of early childhood obesity. The main aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of LEP , LEPR , and MC4R gene variants among a cohort of Egyptian patients with severe early onset obesity. The current cross-sectional study included 30 children who developed obesity during the first year of life with BMI > 2SD (for age and sex). The studied patients were subjected to full medical history taking, anthropometric measurements, serum leptin and insulin assays, and genetic testing of LEP , LEPR and MC4R . Disease causing variants in LEP and LEPR were identified in 10/30 patients with a detection rate of 30%. Eight different homozygous variants (two pathogenic, three likely pathogenic, and three variants of uncertain significant) were identified in the two genes, including six previously unreported LEPR variants. Of them, a new frameshift variant in LEPR gene (c.1045delT, p.S349Lfs*22) was recurrent in two unrelated families and seems to have a founder effect in our population. In conclusion, we reported ten new patients with leptin and leptin receptor deficiencies and identified six novel LEPR variants expanding the mutational spectrum of this rare disorder. Furthermore, the diagnosis of these patients helped us in genetic counseling and patients’ managements specially with the availability of drugs for LEP and LEPR deficiencies.
Recently, using artificial intelligence (AI) in drug discovery has received much attention since it significantly shortens the time and cost of developing new drugs. Deep learning (DL)-based approaches are increasingly being used in all stages of drug development as DL technology advances, and drug-related data grows. Therefore, this paper presents a systematic Literature review (SLR) that integrates the recent DL technologies and applications in drug discovery Including, drug–target interactions (DTIs), drug–drug similarity interactions (DDIs), drug sensitivity and responsiveness, and drug-side effect predictions. We present a review of more than 300 articles between 2000 and 2022. The benchmark data sets, the databases, and the evaluation measures are also presented. In addition, this paper provides an overview of how explainable AI (XAI) supports drug discovery problems. The drug dosing optimization and success stories are discussed as well. Finally, digital twining (DT) and open issues are suggested as future research challenges for drug discovery problems. Challenges to be addressed, future research directions are identified, and an extensive bibliography is also included.
Gene mutation has been a concern for researchers because it results in genetic variations with base changes in molecular structure. Researchers continue to explore methods to detect gene mutations, which may help in disease diagnosis, medication guidance, and so on. Currently, the detection methods, such as whole-genome sequencing and polymerase chain reaction, have some limitations in terms of cost and sensitivity. Ligase (an enzyme) can recognize base mismatch as a commonly used tool in genetic engineering. Therefore, the ligase-related nucleic acid amplification technology for detecting gene mutations has become a research hotspot. In this study, the main techniques explored for detecting gene mutations included the ligase detection reaction, ligase chain reaction, rolling circle amplification reaction, enzyme-assisted polymerase chain reaction, and loop-mediated isothermal amplification reaction. This review aimed to analyze the aforementioned techniques and mainly present their advantages and disadvantages, sensitivity, specificity, cost, detection time, applications, and so on. The findings may help develop sufficient grounds for further studies on detecting gene mutations.
‘The clock to type 1 diabetes has started when islet antibodies are first detected’, commented George Eisenbarth with regard to the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. This review focuses on ‘starting the clock’, i.e. the initiation of pre-symptomatic islet autoimmunity/the first appearance of islet autoantibodies. In particular, this review addresses why susceptibility to developing islet autoimmunity is greatest in the first 2 years of life and why beta cells are a frequent target of the immune system during this fertile period. A concept for the development of beta cell autoimmunity in childhood is discussed and three factors are highlighted that contribute to this early predisposition: (1) high beta cell activity and potential vulnerability to stress; (2) high rates of and first exposures to infection; and (3) a heightened immune response, with a propensity for T helper type 1 (Th1) immunity. Arguments are presented that beta cell injury, accompanied by activation of an inflammatory immune response, precedes the initiation of autoimmunity. Finally, the implications for strategies aimed at primary prevention for a world without type 1 diabetes are discussed. Graphical Abstract 
The usage of microorganisms as biocontrol agents and biofertilizers has been recommended and recognized as an ecologically correct alternative to maintaining the productivity and safety of crops. Thus, the objectives of this work were to characterize twelve strains belonging to Invertebrate Bacteria Collection of Embrapa Genetic Resources and Biotechnology by molecular, morphological, and biochemical methods and to evaluate the pathogenicity of these strains against pests and diseases of agricultural interest. The morphological characteristic of the strains was performed according to the principles of Bergy's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology. The genomes of the 12 strains were sequenced in Macrogen, Inc. (Seoul, Korea) using the HiSeq2000 and GS-FLX Plus high-performance platforms. In the determination of antibiotic sensibility profiles, disc-diffusion methods (Cefar Diagnótica Ltda) were adopted©. Selective bioassays were carried out with insects of the Lepidoptera ( Spodoptera frugiperda , Helicoverpa armigera, and Chrysodeixis includens ), Coleoptera ( Anthonomus grandis) , Diptera ( Aedes aegypti) and Hemiptera ( Euschistus heros ) orders, and with the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans . In addition, the antagonistic action of the phytopathogens Fusarium oxysporum f. sp . vasinfectum and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum against the strains under study, and in vitro assays of phosphate solubilization were also performed. Sequencing of the complete genome of the 12 strains determined that all of them belonged to the Bacillus subtilis sensu lato group. In the strains genome were detected genic clusters responsible for encoding secondary metabolites such as surfactin, iturin, fengycins/plipastatin, bacillomycin, bacillisin, and siderophores. Due to the production of these compounds, there was a survival reduction of the Lepidoptera order insects and a reduction in the phytopathogens mycelial growth. These results show that the species of group B. subtilis s.l. can become promising microbiological alternatives to pest and disease control.
Two Enterobacter strains 155092^T and 170,225 were isolated from clinical samples, pus and sputum, from two hospitalised patients separately, in China. Preliminary identification using Vitek II microbiology system assigned the strains to the Enterobacter cloacae complex. The two strains were subjected to genome sequencing and genome-based taxonomy analysis with type strains of all Enterobacter species and those within closely related genera Huaxiibacter , Leclercia, Lelliottia, and Pseudoenterobacter . The average nucleotide identity (ANI) and in silico DNA–DNA hybridisation (isDDH) values between the two strains were 98.35% and 89.4%, respectively, suggesting that they belong to one species. The two strains had the highest ANI (95.02% and 95.04%) with the type strain of Enterobacter quasiroggenkampii . Their highest isDDH values, also seen with the type strain of E. quasiroggenkampii , were 59.5% and 59.8%, well below the 70% cutoff to define species. The two strains were also characterised for morphological and biochemical features by a set of experiments and observations. The abilities of metabolising gelatin and L-rhamnose could differentiate the two strains from all currently known Enterobacter species. Collectively, the two strains represent a novel Enterobacter species, for which we propose Enterobacter pseudoroggenkampii sp. nov. as the species name. The type strain of this novel species is155092^T (= GDMCC 1.3415^T = JCM 35646^T). The two strains also carried multiple virulence factors comprising aerobactin-encoding iucABCD-iutA and salmochelin-encoding iroN . The two strains also had chromosomally located qnrE , a gene associated with reduced susceptibility to quinolones, suggesting that this species is a potential reservoir of qnrE genes.
The transcriptomic regulation induced by isotretinoin ( 13-cis retinoic acid) is still a matter of debate as short-term exposures of immortalized sebocytes with isotretinoin produced conflicting results. Based on translational evidence, it has been hypothesized that oral isotretinoin treatment upregulates the expression of the transcription factor p53. Twenty-five patients suffering from acne vulgaris were treated with isotretinoin (0.6 mg/kg body weight) for 6 weeks. Biopsies from back skin were taken before and after isotretinoin treatment for the determination of p53 expression by immunohistochemical staining, quantification of p53 protein concentration by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and TP53 gene expression by quantitative reverse transcription real time PCR. Fifteen socio-demographically cross-matched healthy volunteers served as controls. Isotretinoin treatment significantly increased the nuclear expression of p53 in sebaceous glands of treated patients compared to pre-treatment levels and p53 levels of untreated controls. Furthermore, the p53 protein and gene expression significantly increased in the skin after treatment. The magnitude of p53 expression showed an inverse correlation to acne severity score and body mass index. Under clinical conditions, isotretinoin induced the expression of p53, which controls multiple transcription factors involved in the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris including FoxO1, androgen receptor and critical genes involved in the induction of autophagy and apoptosis. Increased p53-FoxO1 signalling enhanced by systemic isotretinoin treatment explains the underlying transcriptomic changes causing sebum suppression but also the adverse effects associated with systemic isotretinoin therapy.
Despite their economic importance worldwide, potato plants are sensitive to various abiotic constraints, such as drought and high temperatures, which cause significant losses in yields and tuber quality. Moreover, because of the climate change phenomenon, plants are frequently subjected to combined stresses, mainly high temperatures and drought. In this context, breeding for tolerant varieties should consider not only plant response to drought or high temperature but also to combined stresses. In the current study, we studied transgenic potato plants overexpressing an ethylene response transcription factor (TF; StERF94 ) involved in abiotic stress response signaling pathways. Our previous results showed that these transgenic plants display tolerance to salt stress more than wildtype (WT). In this work, we aimed to investigate the effects of drought, heat, and combined stresses on transgenic potato plants overexpressing StERF 94 TF under in vitro culture conditions. The obtained results revealed that StERF94 overexpression improved the tolerance of the transgenic plants to drought, heat, and combined stresses through better control of the leaf water and chlorophyll contents, activation of antioxidant enzymes, and an accumulation of proline, especially in the leaves. Indeed, the expression level of antioxidant enzyme-encoding genes (CuZnSOD, FeSOD, CAT1, and CAT2) was significantly induced by the different stress conditions in the transgenic potato plants compared with the WT plants. This study further confirms that StERF 94 TF may be implicated in regulating the expression of target genes encoding antioxidant enzymes.
Breast cancer (BC) leads to the most amounts of deaths among women. Chemo-, endocrine-, and targeted therapies are the mainstay drug treatments for BC in the clinic. However, drug resistance is a major obstacle for BC patients, and it leads to poor prognosis. Accumulating evidences suggested that noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are intricately linked to a wide range of pathological processes, including drug resistance. Till date, the correlation between drug resistance and ncRNAs is not completely understood in BC. Herein, we comprehensively summarized a dysregulated ncRNAs landscape that promotes or inhibits drug resistance in chemo-, endocrine-, and targeted BC therapies. Our review will pave way for the effective management of drug resistance by targeting oncogenic ncRNAs, which, in turn will promote drug sensitivity of BC in the future.
Background Newborn screening (NBS) is an important and successful public health program that helps improve the long-term clinical outcomes of newborns by providing early diagnosis and treatment of certain inborn diseases. The development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology provides new opportunities to expand current newborn screening methodologies. Methods We designed a a newborn genetic screening (NBGS) panel targeting 135 genes associated with 75 inborn disorders by multiplex PCR combined with NGS. With this panel, a large-scale, multicenter, prospective multidisease analysis was conducted on dried blood spot (DBS) profiles from 21,442 neonates nationwide. Results We presented the positive detection rate and carrier frequency of diseases and related variants in different regions; and 168 (0.78%) positive cases were detected. Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDD) and phenylketonuria (PKU) had higher prevalence rates, which were significantly different in different regions. The positive detection of G6PD variants was quite common in south China, whereas PAH variants were most commonly identified in north China. In addition, NBGS identified 3 cases with DUOX2 variants and one with SLC25A13 variants, which were normal in conventional NBS, but were confirmed later as abnormal in repeated biochemical testing after recall. Eighty percent of high-frequency gene carriers and 60% of high-frequency variant carriers had obvious regional differences. On the premise that there was no significant difference in birth weight and gestational age, the biochemical indicators of SLC22A5 c.1400C > G and ACADSB c.1165A > G carriers were significantly different from those of non-carriers. Conclusions We demonstrated that NBGS is an effective strategy to identify neonates affected with treatable diseases as a supplement to current NBS methods. Our data also showed that the prevalence of diseases has significant regional characteristics, which provides a theoretical basis for screening diseases in different regions.
Single-cell ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing technology is used to analyze transcriptomes of each cell individually and helps to identify rare cell populations. By using traditional applications, it is difficult to understand and analyze the transcriptomic profiles of cells at the single-cell level. So, to overcome these kinds of issues, machine learning technologies are playing a great role. In this paper, we analyzed single-cell RNA seq data by implementing linear dimensional reduction, identifying highly variable features, clustering the cells, nonlinear dimensional reduction, and identifying gene markers. This type of single-cell RNA sequencing analysis is much needed in identifying transcriptomic profile challenges in cells and heterogeneous characteristics. Our study helps researchers who are doing fundamental research in the field of bioinformatics and computational biology concerning single-cell RNA sequencing data.
Choreoacanthocytosis, one of the forms of neuroacanthocytosis, is caused by mutations in vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein A ( VPS13A ), and is often misdiagnosed with other form of neuroacanthocytosis with discrete genetic defects. The phenotypic variations among the patients with VPS13A mutations significantly obfuscates the understanding of the disease and treatment strategies. In this study, two unrelated cases were identified, exhibiting the core phenotype of neuroacanthocytosis but with considerable clinical heterogeneity. Case 1 presented with an additional Parkinsonism phenotype, whereas seizures were evident in case 2. To decipher the genetic basis, whole exome sequencing followed by validation with Sanger sequencing was performed. A known homozygous pathogenic nonsense mutation (c.799C > T; p.R267X) in exon 11 of the VPS13A gene was identified in case 1 that resulted in a truncated protein. A novel missense mutation (c.9263T > G; p.M3088R) in exon 69 of VPS13A identified in case 2 was predicted as pathogenic. In silico analysis of the p.M3088R mutation at the C-terminus of VPS13A suggests a loss of interaction with TOMM40 and may disrupt mitochondrial localization. We also observed an increase in mitochondrial DNA copy numbers in case 2. Mutation analysis revealed benign heterozygous variants in interacting partners of VPS13A such as VAPA in case 1. Our study confirmed the cases as ChAc and identified the novel homozygous variant of VPS13A (c.9263T > G; p.M3088R) within the mutation spectrum of VPS13A- associated ChAc. Furthermore, mutations in VPS13A and co-mutations in its potential interacting partner(s) might contribute to the diverse clinical manifestations of ChAc, which requires further study.
