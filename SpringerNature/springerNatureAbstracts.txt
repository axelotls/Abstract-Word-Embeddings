Pullulan is a commercially available exopolymer biosynthesized by Aureobasidium pullulans supplemented with nitrogen, carbon and other vital components through submerged and solid-state fermentation. These nutrients are very expensive and it raises the cost for the production of pullulan. Hence, the need of alternative cost-effective raw materials for its production is a prerequisite. Owing to its unique physicochemical features, pullulan has various applications in the food, pharmacological, and biomedical domains. Food industrial wastes generate a considerable number of by-products which accumulates and has a negative influence on the environment. These by-products are made up of proteins, carbohydrates, and other components, can be employed as substrates for the production of pullulan. The present review briefs on the pullulan production using food processing waste and by-products and the elements that impact it. It provides an insight into versatile applications of pullulan in food industries. Various challenges and future prospects in the field of research on pullulan production have been uncovered.
The aim of this work was to determine the proximate, mineral, amino acid composition, antioxidant activity, anti-nutritional factors, total dietary fiber, total phenolic content and technological properties of C. limetta peels. Moreover, analytical techniques including FT-IR and SEM were also conducted to study the morphological and structural properties of C. limetta peels. Considering the proximate, mineral, and amino acid composition, C. limetta peels was found to be a good source of ash (3.06 ± 0.20%), crude fiber (10.13 ± 0.30%), carbohydrate (64.08 ± 0.55%), protein (7.56 ± 0.25%), potassium (125.9671 mg/100 g), calcium (112.5861 mg/100 g), magnesium (16.43 mg/100 g), asparagine (2111.06 nmol/mg), glutamic acid (1331.96 nmol/g), and aspartic acid (1162.19 nmol/mg). Furthermore, they contain an appreciable amount of total dietary fiber (48.73 ± 0.45%), total phenolic content (14.30 ± 0.03 mg GAE/g), and antioxidant activity (52.65 ± 0.10%). Moreover, the antinutritional factors present in C. limetta peels were observed to be within the threshold limit. The results of technological properties of peels suggested that they can be potentially utilized as good emulsifying, gelling, foaming, and bulking agents in food industries. Therefore, C. limetta peels can be successfully re-utilized as natural food additive with numerous nutritive and bioactive properties in food sector, thereby achieving zero waste generation.
Purpose To investigate the feasibility of high-resolution readout-segmented echo-planar imaging (rs-EPI) with simultaneous multislice (SMS) imaging to predict well-differentiated rectal cancer.Kindly check and confirm whether the Author Name 'Hongyun Huang ' is correctly identified.confirm Methods A total of eighty-three patients with nonmucinous rectal adenocarcinoma received both prototype SMS high-spatial-resolution and conventional rs-EPI sequences. Image quality was subjectively assessed by two experienced radiologists using a 4-point Likert scale (1 = poor, 4 = excellent). The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the lesion were measured by two experienced radiologists in the objective assessment. Paired t tests or Mann‒Whitney U tests were used to compare the two groups. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUCs) were used to determine the predictive value of the ADCs in discriminating well-differentiated rectal cancer in the two groups. A two-sided p value < 0.05 represented statistical significance.Please check and confirm if the authors and affiliation details have been correctly identified. Amend if necessary.confirm Results In the subjective assessment, high-resolution rs-EPI had better image quality than conventional rs-EPI ( p  < 0.001). High-resolution rs-EPI also had a significantly higher SNR and CNR ( p  < 0.001). The T stage of rectal cancer was inversely correlated with the ADCs measured on high-resolution rs-EPI ( r  = -0.622, p  < 0.001) and rs-EPI ( r  = -0.567, p  < 0.001). The AUC of high-resolution rs-EPI in predicting well-differentiated rectal cancer was 0.768. Conclusion High-resolution rs-EPI with SMS imaging provided significantly higher image quality, SNRs, and CNRs and more stable ADC measurements than conventional rs-EPI. Additionally, the pretreatment ADC on high-resolution rs-EPI could discriminate well-differentiated rectal cancer. Graphical abstract 
Purpose To investigative the performance of MRI-radiomics analysis derived from T2WI and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) images before and after neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (nCRT) separately or simultaneously for predicting post-nCRT lymph node status in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Materials and Methods Eighty-three patients (training cohort, n  = 57; validation cohort, n  = 26) with LARC between June 2017 and December 2022 were retrospectively enrolled. All the radiomics features were extracted from volume of interest on T2WI and ADC images from baseline and post-nCRT MRI. Delta-radiomics features were defined as the difference between radiomics features before and after nCRT. Seven clinical-radiomics models were constructed by combining the most predictive radiomics signatures and clinical parameters selected from support vector machine. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to evaluate the performance of models. The optimum model-based LNM was applied to assess 5-years disease-free survival (DFS) using Kaplan–Meier analysis. The end point was clinical or radiological locoregional recurrence or distant metastasis during postoperative follow-up. Results Clinical-deltaADC radiomics combined model presented good performance for predicting post-CRT LNM in the training (AUC = 0.895,95%CI:0.838–0.953) and validation cohort (AUC = 0.900,95%CI:0.771–1.000). Clinical-deltaADC radiomics-postT2WI radiomics combined model also showed good performances (AUC = 0.913,95%CI:0.838–0.953) in the training and (AUC = 0.912,95%CI:0.771–1.000) validation cohort. As for subgroup analysis, clinical-deltaADC radiomics combined model showed good performance predicting LNM in ypT0-T2 (AUC = 0.827;95%CI:0.649–1.000) and ypT3-T4 stage (AUC = 0.934;95%CI:0.864–1.000). In ypT0-T2 stage, clinical-deltaADC radiomics combined model-based LNM could assess 5-years DFS ( P  = 0.030). Conclusion Clinical-deltaADC radiomics combined model could predict post-nCRT LNM, and this combined model-based LNM was associated with 5-years DFS in ypT0-T2 stage. Graphical Abstract 
Purpose Classical prognostic indicators of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) can no longer meet the clinical needs of precision medicine. This study aimed to establish a radiomics model to predict Granzyme A (GZMA) expression in patients with HNSCC. Methods We downloaded transcriptomic data of HNSCC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas for prognosis analysis and then used corresponding enhanced computed tomography (CT) images from The Cancer Imaging Archive for feature extraction and model construction. We explored the influence of differences in GZMA expression on signaling pathways and analyzed the potential molecular mechanism and its relationship with immune cell infiltration. Subsequently, non-invasive CT radiomics models were established to predict the expression of GZMA mRNA and evaluate the correlation with the radiomics-score (Rad-score), related genes, and prognosis. Results We found that GZMA was highly expressed in tumor tissues, and high GZMA expression was a protective factor for overall survival. The degree of B and T lymphocyte and natural killer cell infiltration was significantly correlated with GZMA expression. The receiver operating characteristic curve showed that the Relief GBM and RFE_GBM radiomics models had good predictive ability, and there were significant differences in the Rad-score distribution between the high- and low- GZMA -expression groups. Conclusions GZMA expression can significantly affect the prognosis of patients with HNSCC. Enhanced CT radiomics models can effectively predict the expression of GZMA mRNA.
Developing meat alternatives has recently become a popular topic in the food and research communities. In this review, we summarized and focused on various structuring technologies to produce meat alternatives obtained from plants, cultured cells, and edible insects. Plant-based meats were mainly produced by soybeans and wheat, and the texture of meat alternatives obtained from plant sources was improved using extrusion, shear cell, and electrospinning technologies. Cultured meats were mainly produced by stem cell technology using 3D bioprinting, microcarriers, and scaffolds to form aligned tissues. Most edible insects were not only used as alternative protein sources using heating or freeze-drying processes; they also produced oils using supercritical extraction and solvent extraction processes producing meat alternatives. This review provides information about the current research on meat alternatives to improve their structures.
Purpose The importance of lateral pelvic lymph node dissection (LLND) for advanced low rectal cancer is gradually being recognized in Europe and the USA, where some patients were affected by uncontrolled lateral pelvic lymph node (LLNs) metastasis, even after total mesorectal excision (TME) with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT). The purpose of this study was thus to compare robotic LLND (R-LLND) with laparoscopic (L-LLND) to clarify the safety and advantages of R-LLND. Methods Sixty patients were included in this single-institution retrospective study between January 2013 and July 2022. We compared the short-term outcomes of 27 patients who underwent R-LLND and 33 patients who underwent L-LLND. Results En bloc LLND was performed in significantly more patients in the R-LLND than in the L-LLND group (48.1% vs. 15.2%; p  = 0.006). The numbers of LLNs on the distal side of the internal iliac region (LN 263D) harvested were significantly higher in the R-LLND than in the L-LLND group (2 [0–9] vs. 1 [0–6]; p  = 0.023). The total operative time was significantly longer in the R-LLND than in the L-LLND group (587 [460–876] vs. 544 [398–859]; p  = 0.003); however, the LLND time was not significantly different between groups ( p  = 0.718). Postoperative complications were not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusion The present study clarified the safety and technical feasibility of R-LLND with respect to L-LLND. Our findings suggest that the robotic approach offers a key advantage, allowing significantly more LLNs to be harvested from the distal side of the internal iliac region (LN 263D). Prospective clinical trials examining the oncological superiority of R-LLND are thus necessary in the near future.
What is already known on this subject? Women have reported a lack of attention to their needs by health practitioners during the transition to parenthood. Health professionals explain that there is a certain negligence of parental dietary health in antenatal and postnatal care due to a lack of time and resources for nutrition counseling. What does this study add? We provide a potentially reliable theory-based tool for assessing constraints to healthy eating among mothers of young children. The study answers a call for evidence-based instruments to support that the work of midwives and other practitioners involved in new mothers’ and their families’ care is time-optimized. Objectives This study aims to propose and evaluate a theory-driven questionnaire addressing barriers to healthy eating among mothers of young children. Methods Statements drawing upon the Social Cognitive Theory were developed/gathered based on literature review and previous qualitative research. Part I (43 items) included general barriers, attitudes to nutrition advice and outcome expectations. Part II (9 items) included subjective knowledge and general self-efficacy scales. An online survey was undertaken with 267 Danish women. The validation process included content and face validity, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and reliability analysis. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) tested possible associations between the constructs and potential health outcomes (BMI and healthiness of eating habits). Results The EFA supported an adequate factorial validity with a 5-factor, 37-item structure model for Part I, and a high internal reliability of Parts I and II (Cronbach’s alpha > 0.7). The CFA revealed an association between certain constructs and perceived healthiness of eating and BMI. Results support the reliability and factorial validity of the social cognitive measures assessing barriers to healthy eating among mothers. Conclusions for Practice These promising findings of reliability and initial validity suggest that researchers and practitioners interested in identifying women who face difficulties in the family food environment may find the scales useful. We propose a short version of the questionnaire for health practitioners.
Background In current practice, rates of locally recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC) are low due to the use of the total mesorectal excision (TME) in combination with various neoadjuvant treatment strategies. However, the literature on LRRC mainly consists of single- and multicenter retrospective cohort studies, which are prone to selection bias. The aim of this study is to provide a nationwide, population-based overview of LRRC after TME in the Netherlands. Patients and Methods In total, 1431 patients with nonmetastasized primary rectal cancer diagnosed in the first six months of 2015 and treated with TME were included from the nationwide, population-based Netherlands Cancer Registry. Data on disease recurrence were collected for patients diagnosed in these 6 months only. Competing risk cumulative incidence, competing risk regression, and Kaplan–Meier analyses were performed to assess incidence, risk factors, treatment, and overall survival (OS) of LRRC. Results Three-year cumulative incidence of LRRC was 6.4%; synchronous distant metastases (LRRC-M1) were present in 44.9% of patients with LRRC. Distal localization, R1–2 margin, (y)pT3-4, and (y)pN1-2 were associated with an increased LRRC rate. No differences in LRRC treatment and OS were found between patients who had been treated with or without prior n(C)RT. Curative-intent treatment was given to 42.9% of patients with LRRC, and 3-year OS thereafter was 70%. Conclusions Nationwide LRRC incidence was low. A high proportion of patients with LRRC underwent curative-intent treatment, and OS of this group was high in comparison with previous studies. Additionally, n(C)RT for primary rectal cancer was not associated with differences in treatment and OS of LRRC.
Background Targeted axillary dissection (TAD), with marking of the metastatic lymph node before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), is increasingly used for breast cancer axillary staging. In the case of axillary pathological complete response (ax-pCR), axillary lymph node clearance can be omitted. Several marking methods exist, most using re-marking before surgery. Feasibility, learning curve, and identification rate (IR) vary. Marking with ^125I seed before NACT makes re-marking at surgery redundant, possibly increasing feasibility and IR. Here, TAD with ^125I seed placed before NACT is evaluated in a Danish multicenter cohort. Methods Patients staged with ^125I TAD in Denmark between 1 January 2016 and 31 August 2021 were included. Patients were identified in radioactivity-emitting implant registries at the radiology departments and from the Danish Breast Cancer Group database. Data were extracted from patients’ medical records. Information on patient/tumor characteristics, ^125I seed activity, marking period, TAD success, number of sentinel nodes (SNs), the histopathological status of excised nodes, and whether the marked lymph node (MLN) was an SN were registered. Results 142 patients were included. The IR of the MLN was 99.3%, and the IR of the SLNB was 91.5%. TAD success was 91.5%. Minor challenges in marking or removal of the MLN were noted in three patients. In 72.3% of the patients, the MLN was a sentinel node. Overall, 40.8% had axillary pCR. Conclusion TAD with ^125I seed marking before NACT is feasible without re-marking at surgery and with only minor surgical challenges. The IR is high. Staging with TAD spares 41% of breast cancer patients an axillary dissection.
Molasses wastewater contains high levels of organic compounds, cations, and anions, causing operational problems for anaerobic biological treatment. In this study, an upflow anaerobic filter (UAF) reactor was employed to establish a high organic loading treatment system for molasses wastewater and further investigated the microbial community dynamics in response to this stressful operation. The biogas production increased with an increase in total organic carbon (TOC) loading rate from 1.0 to 14 g/L/day, and then it decreased with further TOC loading rate addition until 16 g/L/day. The UAF reactor achieved a maximum biogas production of 6800 mL/L/day with a TOC removal efficiency of 66.5% at a TOC loading rate of 14 g/L/day. Further microbial analyses revealed that both the bacterial and archaeal communities developed multiple strategies to maintain stable operation of the reactor at high organic loading (e.g., Proteiniphilum and Defluviitoga maintained high abundances throughout the operation; Tissierella temporarily dominated the bacterial community at TOC loading rates of 8.0 to 14 g/L/day; and multi-trophic Methanosarcina shifted as the dominant methanogen at the TOC loading rates of 8.0 to 16 g/L/day). This study presents insights into a high organic loading molasses wastewater treatment system and the microbial flexibility in methane fermentation in response to process disturbances.
Optimization of crop production inputs to reduce energy input and greenhouse gases emissions with maximizing economic productivity is needed to develop sustainable agriculture under groundwater-based irrigation conditions. This paper examined the effects of irrigated wheat tillage practices on energy indices, greenhouse gases emissions, and economic indices. Research treatments were conventional tillage and no-tillage (environment-friendly) systems in semi-arid environments. This study was conducted in wheat farms under groundwater-based irrigation, and data were monitored and collected for two years between 2012–2013 and 2013–2014. The results indicated that no-tillage practice had lower energy input (13%, 21.12 vs. 24.34 GJ ha^−1), energy output (18%, 83.01 vs. 101.11 GJ ha^−1), and energy use efficiency (7%), but higher energy productivity (19%) and indirect energy (9%) than conventional tillage practice. Moreover, no-tillage practice produced lower emissions of CO_2 (24%, 830.28 vs. 1096.40 kg ha^−1) and total global warming potential (GWP) (14%, 1830.03 vs. 2120.43 kg CO_2-equivalents ha^−1) than conventional tillage practice. In comparison, 53.9% of GWP originated from N_2O and 45.4% from CO_2. Inputs of electricity, diesel fuel, machinery, and nitrogen fertilizer had 95% contributions in emission from farms. Economically, no-tillage practice had higher productivity (3%, 7.06 vs. 6.86 kg US$^−1) but lower net return (18%, 1076.52 vs. 1313.48 US$ ha^−1) and benefit to cost ratio (14%, 3.10 vs. 3.61) than conventional tillage practice. However, producing wheat in this agroecosystem is profitable and beneficial under both tillage systems. It was concluded that the promising technique of the no-tillage under groundwater-based irrigation conditions significantly facilitated a cleaner production of wheat through managing energy with controlling greenhouse gases emissions in a semi-arid environment.

The behavior of gut microbiota is closely involved in sustaining balanced immune and metabolic homeostasis, and the dysbiosis of gut microbiota can lead to severe disease. Foods and dietary patterns are the primary drivers in shaping/designing gut microbiota compositions and their metabolites across the lifetime. This indicates the importance of functional molecules present in the food matrix in the life of gut microbiota and their influence on the host’s biological system. In this contribution, the effects of different dietary choices and bioactive compounds (i.e., phenolics, vitamins, carotenoids) on gut microbiome compositions and their metabolites are comprehensively discussed by focusing on neurotransmitters. This study may provide useful information that fills a gap in understanding the role of the gut microbiota and its alterations as affected by foods and food-derived bioactives.
Active packaging systems come under novel techniques and are creating demands in food packaging aspects. They are specially designed for food products where shelf life is a key driving factor. Their wide range of functionality preserves the color, texture, smell, and taste of the food item retaining their freshness and edibility for longer than any other methods available on market. An active ingredient in packaging systems enables efficient consumable quality which resulted in reduced complaints from consumers. However, techniques must be inexpensive and environment-friendly. The use of biodegradable packaging systems reinforced by exploiting natural compounds forms the latest trend to attract consumer demand in substituting synthetic preservatives in foods that can protect against food spoilage. Natural extracts have gained commercial importance in active packaging nowadays for the delivery of safe and high-quality foods that are being employed in both fresh and processed produce. Development and use of innovative active packaging systems in varied forms are expected to increase in the future for food safety, quality, and stability. The review overviews the beneficial effects of plant acquired components in modulating product quality in packaged form for commercial aspects in the market.
WRKY transcription factors play an important role in the immune system and the innate defense response of plants. WRKY transcription factors have great feedback on nitrogen stress. In this study, bioinformatics was used to detect the WRKY s of Panax notoginseng ( PnWRKYs ). The response of PnWRKYs under nitrogen stress was also well studied. PnWRKYs were distributed on 11 chromosomes. According to PnWRKY and Arabidopsis thaliana WRKY (AtWRKY) domains, these PnWRKY proteins were divided into three groups by phylogenetic analysis. MEME analysis showed that almost every member contained motif 1 and motif 2. PlantCARE online predicted the cis-acting elements of the promoter. PnWRKY gene family members obtained 22 pairs of repeat fragments by collinearity analysis. The expression levels of PnWRKYs in different parts (roots, flowers, and leafs) were analyzed by the gene expression pattern. They reflected tissue-specific expressions. The qRT-PCR experiments were used to detect 74 PnWRKYs under nitrogen stress. The results showed that the expression levels of 8 PnWRKYs were significantly induced. The PnWRKY gene family may be involved in biotic/abiotic stresses and hormone induction. This study will not only lay the foundation to explore the functions of PnWRKYs but also provide candidate genes for the future improvement of P. notoginseng .
Tailoring a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for an implementation is a tedious and time-consuming task especially in image identification. In this study, an optimization scheme based on artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm so-called optimal deep CNN (ODC) classifier for hyperparameter optimization of deep CNN is proposed for plant species identification. It is implemented to a ready-made leaf dataset namely Folio containing #637 images with 32 different plant species. The images are undergone various image preprocessing such as scaling, segmentation and augmentation so as to improve the efficacy of the ODC classifier. Therefore, the dataset is augmented from #637 to #15,288 leaf images whose #12,103 images is allocated for training phase and the remainder for testing the ODC. Moreover, a validation process on 20% of the training dataset is performed along with the training phase in both optimization and classification stages. The accuracy and loss performance of the ODC are examined over the training and validation results. The achieved ODC is verified through the test phase as well as by a comparison with the results in the literature in terms of performance evaluation metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and F1-score. In order to further corroborate the proposed scheme, it is even subjected to a benchmark with optimization-based studies such as genetic, particle swarm and firefly algorithms through MNIST digit-image dataset. The ODC identifies the leaf images and digit-images with the best accuracy of 98.99% and 99.21% surpassing the state of the arts. Therefore, the proposed ODC is effective and useful in achieving an optimal CNN thanks to ABC algorithm.
CONSTANS - LIKE ( COL ) genes are considered the core components in photoperiod regulation and contribute to flowering regulation. Liriodendron chinense is a rare relict plant of the Magnoliaceae family. Having beautiful flowers like a tulip, L. chinense is now popularly used as an ornamental tree species. However, the COL genes of L. chinense have not yet been investigated. Here, we multidimensionally identify and characterize the COL genes in L. chinense , including their phylogenetic relationships, conserved motifs, cis -acting elements, expression patterns, and ectopic transformations. Nine LcCOL genes were identified across the L. chinense genome and were located on seven chromosomes. These nine LcCOL genes could be phylogenetically clustered into three groups (I, II, and III), with three, five and one COL members in each group, respectively. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) showed that the expression of LcCOL genes exhibited diverse patterns in various tissues. Moreover, LcCO and LcCOL3 displayed seasonal patterns, indicating that LcCO and LcCOL3 may play roles in flowering regulation. To analyze the function of the LcCO gene, we subsequently transferred LcCO into Arabidopsis thaliana via agrobacterium inflorescence infection, and found that overexpression of LcCO in A. thaliana caused earlier flowering and fewer rosette leaves under long-day condition. By RT-qPCR, we show that overexpression of LcCO co-regulates the expression of AtFLC , AtSOC1 and AtFT in transgenic Arabidopsis. Our study identified the COL members in L. chinense genome and laid a cornerstone for further functional characterization of LcCOL genes.
Recommender systems are widely adopted as an increasing research and development area, since they provide users with diverse and useful information tailored to their needs. Several strategies have been proposed, and in most of them some concept of similarity is used as a core part of the approach, either between items or between users. At the same time, Siamese Neural Networks are being used to capture the similarity of items in the image domain, as they are defined as a subtype of Artificial Neural Networks built with (at least two) identical networks that share their weights. In this review, we study the proposals done in the intersection of these two fields, that is, how Siamese Networks are being used for recommendation. We propose a classification that considers different recommendation problems and algorithmic approaches. Some research directions are pointed out to encourage future research. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first comprehensive survey that focuses on the usage of Siamese Neural Networks for Recommender Systems.
Biopolymers are mainly the polymers which are created or obtained from living creatures such as plants and bacteria rather than petroleum, which has traditionally been the source of polymers. Biopolymers are chain-like molecules composed of repeated chemical blocks derived from renewable resources that may decay in the environment. The usage of biomaterials is becoming more popular as a means of reducing the use of non-renewable resources and reducing environmental pollution produced by synthetic materials. Biopolymers' biodegradability and non-toxic nature help to maintain our environment clean and safe. This study discusses how to improve the mechanical and physical characteristics of biopolymers, particularly in the realm of bioengineering. The paper begins with a fundamental introduction and progresses to a detailed examination of synthesis and a unique investigation of several recent focused biopolymers with mechanical, physical, and biological characterization. Biopolymers' unique non-toxicity, biodegradability, biocompatibility, and eco-friendly features are boosting their applications, especially in bioengineering fields, including agriculture, pharmaceuticals, biomedical, ecological, industrial, aqua treatment, and food packaging, among others, at the end of this paper. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the relevance of biopolymers in smart and novel bioengineering applications. Graphical abstract The Graphical abstract represents the biological sources and applications of biopolymers. Plants, bacteria, animals, agriculture wastes, and fossils are all biological sources for biopolymers, which are chemically manufactured from biological monomer units, including sugars, amino acids, natural fats and oils, and nucleotides. Biopolymer modification (chemical or physical) is recognized as a crucial technique for modifying physical and chemical characteristics, resulting in novel materials with improved capabilities and allowing them to be explored to their full potential in many fields of application such as tissue engineering, drug delivery, agriculture, biomedical, food industries, and industrial applications.
In recent times, the need for food systems that, in addition to being economically viable and socially equitable, use environmentally friendly production processes has made sustainable production one of the olive oil sector's main concerns and priorities. In this context, evaluation of the economic, social and environmental performance of olive oil companies and the design of sustainable management alternatives have become fundamental activities for companies. Thus, this article's main objective is to measure the sustainability of a representative sample of olive mills located in Andalusia (Spain), the leading olive oil-producing region internationally, and to identify its determinants. First, based on data envelopment analysis, synthetic sustainability indices are constructed. Second, truncated regression analysis and bootstrapping techniques are used to identify the determinants of the sustainability of olive oil mills. The results show that factors such as company size, commitment to quality, and manager training and professionalisation are crucial elements for the sustainable development of olive oil mills. These results can be useful for company managers in the design of strategies aimed at improving company sustainability.
Background Pretreatment diagnosis of lateral pelvic lymph node (LPLN) metastasis is critical in deciding the therapeutic strategy for locally advanced rectal cancer. We aimed to investigate computed tomography (CT) cut-off values and diagnostic and prognostic implications of lateral pelvic lymph node metastasis (LPLNM) in rectal cancer. Methods Patients with rectal cancer ( n  = 126) who underwent primary tumor resection between April 2010 and July 2020 were included. CT findings and diagnostic accuracies were analyzed. Results In this study, the cut-off values of 7 mm for long-axis diameter and 5 mm for short-axis diameter were selected. At cut-offs of 7 mm for long-axis diameter, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy were 88.9%, 93.8%, 34.8%, 99.6%, and 93.7%, respectively. At cut-offs of 5 mm for short-axis diameter, the values of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy were 88.9%, 90.9%, 26.7%, 99.5%, and 90.9%, respectively. CT findings of ≥ 7 mm for long-axis diameter (odds ratio, 68.0) and ≥ 5 mm for short-axis diameter (odds ratio, 38.4) were strong predictors of LPLNM. In the subgroup analysis of patients with enlarged LPLN (≥ 7 mm), higher recurrence-free survival and lower local recurrence rates were found in patients who had LPLN dissection (5-year recurrence-free survival: 100% vs. 58.3%, p  = 0.17 with LPLN dissection; and 5-year local recurrence: 0% vs. 31.4%, p  = 0.27, without LPLN dissection). Conclusion Pretreatment CT at cut-off values of 7 mm for the long-axis diameter and 5 mm for the short-axis diameter of LPLN provides sufficient diagnostic accuracy for LPLNM.
This Position Statement updates the different components of the therapy of obesity (lifestyle intervention, drugs, and surgery) in children and adolescents, previously reported in the consensus position statement on pediatric obesity of the Italian Society of Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetology and the Italian Society of Pediatrics. Lifestyle intervention is the first step of treatment. In children older than 12 years, pharmacotherapy is the second step, and bariatric surgery is the third one, in selected cases. Novelties are available in the field of the medical treatment of obesity. In particular, new drugs demonstrated their efficacy and safety and have been approved in adolescents. Moreover, several randomized control trials with other drugs are in process and it is likely that some of them will become available in the future. The increase of the portfolio of treatment options for obesity in children and adolescents is promising for a more effective treatment of this disorder.
Purpose The quantification of radiotherapy (RT)-induced functional and morphological brain alterations is fundamental to guide therapeutic decisions in patients with brain tumors. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows to define structural RT-brain changes, but it is unable to evaluate early injuries and to objectively quantify the volume tissue loss. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools extract accurate measurements that permit an objective brain different region quantification. In this study, we assessed the consistency between an AI software (Quibim Precision^® 2.9) and qualitative neruroradiologist evaluation, and its ability to quantify the brain tissue changes during RT treatment in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Methods GBM patients treated with RT and subjected to MRI assessment were enrolled. Each patient, pre- and post-RT, undergoes to a qualitative evaluation with global cerebral atrophy (GCA) and medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) and a quantitative assessment with Quibim Brain screening and hippocampal atrophy and asymmetry modules on 19 extracted brain structures features. Results A statistically significant strong negative association between the percentage value of the left temporal lobe and the GCA score and the left temporal lobe and the MTA score was found, while a moderate negative association between the percentage value of the right hippocampus and the GCA score and the right hippocampus and the MTA score was assessed. A statistically significant strong positive association between the CSF percentage value and the GCA score and a moderate positive association between the CSF percentage value and the MTA score was found. Finally, quantitative feature values showed that the percentage value of the cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) statistically differences between pre- and post-RT. Conclusions AI tools can support a correct evaluation of RT-induced brain injuries, allowing an objective and earlier assessment of the brain tissue modifications.
Purpose of Review Continuous replanting of land with the same or similar plant species can result in the accumulation of harmful soil microbes, which can lead to crop failure. In this review, we explore the influence of constant replanting on the health of short-rotation forestry soil, focusing on the accumulation of deleterious microbes and the decline of beneficial microbes. We also suggest possible practical solutions to address this problem and consider future research that could be conducted to better understand and reduce the build-up of deleterious soil microbes in short-rotation forestry soil. Recent Findings Compelling evidence that continuous replanting of the same tree species in short-rotation plantation forestry might contribute to the build-up of deleterious soil microbes is still lacking. However, our assessment of existing soil microbiome data from global short-rotation plantation environments suggests a high risk of an accumulation of harmful microbes and a loss of beneficial microbes in plots that were continually replanted with the same tree species. Based on this evidence, and that from agriculture, we propose further research to acquire a better understanding of the build-up of harmful soil microbes in short-rotation plantation forestry, and suggest crop rotation and intercropping strategies to avoid this malady in the future. Summary The accumulation of microbes detrimental to plantation trees and the decline of microbes beneficial to these trees are realistic risks when plantations are continually replanted with the same tree species. Extensive research is necessary to evaluate the impact of short continuous planting rotations on the biodiversity of soil microbes in plantations and to develop strategies that would alleviate the build-up of detrimental microbes.
It is well recognized that synthetic chemical pesticides are crucial in the control of insect pests. However, their detrimental effects on the environment and human health, as well as the emergence of insect pest resistance to these chemical pesticides, have forced the scientific community to search for an effective and sustainable alternative. RNA interference-mediated management of insect pests is one step toward fulfilling this objective. RNAi involves silencing essential genes within insect pests, rendering them unable to cause economic damage to crops. Such a technique makes the process of insect pest management highly specific and effective. However, the efficiency of RNAi varies among insect species. Some of these pests are highly susceptible, while others are least. Lepidopterans which account for a majority of agricultural loss are considered such a group of insects. This is due to various factors like their high gut pH, specific nucleases, failure of siRNA to escape the endosome, and other limiting factors. Improving the efficiency of RNAi is vital for commercializing RNAi as an alternative to conventional pesticides. Various techniques are being tried to overcome these limitations. This review focuses on such techniques and their potential of being employed in pest management.
Abstract Side streams of the dairy industry are a suitable nutrient source for cultivating microorganisms, producing enzymes, and high-value chemical compounds. The heterotrophic Escherichia coli and chemolithoautotroph Ralstonia eutropha are of major biotechnological interest. R. eutropha is a model organism for producing O_2-tolerant [NiFe]-hydrogenases (Hyds) (biocatalysts), and E. coli has found widespread use as an expression platform for producing recombinant proteins, molecular hydrogen (H_2), and other valuable products. Aiming at developing suitable cultivation media from side streams of the dairy industry, the pre-treatment (filtration, dilution, and pH adjustment) of cheese (sweet) whey (SW) and curd (acid) whey (AW), with and without the use of ß-glucosidase, has been performed. Growth parameters (oxidation–reduction potential (ORP), pH changes, specific growth rate, biomass formation) of E. coli BW25113 and R. eutropha H16 type strains were monitored during cultivation on filtered and non-filtered SW and AW at 37 °C, pH 7.5 and 30 °C, pH 7.0, respectively. Along with microbial growth, measurements of pH and ORP indicated good fermentative growth. Compared to growth on fructose-nitrogen minimal salt medium (control), a maximum cell yield (OD_600 4.0) and H_2-oxidizing Hyd activity were achieved in the stationary growth phase for R. eutropha . Hyd-3-dependent H_2 production by E. coli utilizing whey as a growth substrate was demonstrated. Moreover, good biomass production and prolonged H_2 yields of ~ 5 mmol/L and cumulative H_2 ~ 94 mL g/L dry whey (DW) (ß-glucosidase-treated) were observed during the cultivation of the engineered E. coli strain. These results open new avenues for effective whey treatment using thermostable β-glucosidase and confirm whey as an economically viable commodity for biomass and biocatalyst production. Key points • Archaeal thermostable β-glucosidase isolated from the metagenome of a hydrothermal spring was used for lactose hydrolysis in whey. • Hydrogenase enzyme activity was induced during the growth of Ralstonia eutropha H16 on whey. • Enhanced biomass and H _ 2 production was shown in a genetically modified strain of Escherichia coli.

E-waste, also known as waste from electrical and electronic equipment, is a solid waste that accumulates quickly due to high demand driven by the market for replacing newer electrical and electronic products. The global e-waste generation is estimated to be between 53.6 million tons, and it is increasing by 3–5% per year. Metals make-up approximately 30% of e-waste, which contains precious elements Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, and other high-value elements, valued at USD 57 billion, which is driving the e-waste recycling industry. It is noteworthy that the recycling of precious elements from e-waste has emerged as a profitable enterprise in several parts of developing nations. E-waste contains 50–100 times higher levels of precious metals compared to natural ores, making it suitable for mining. E-waste recycling in developing nations, mostly occurs through the informal sector comprising manual collection, crushing, segregation and selling of precious elements, such as Au, Ag, Cu, Pb, Pt, and other rare elements (Nd, In, and Ga). The organized sector, on the other hand, mostly employs mechano-chemical methods, such as pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, and bio-hydrometallurgy, which have serious environmental consequences. Both the informal and formal sectors of e-waste processing lead to the leaching of toxic elements into groundwater and soils. Owing to the lesser efficiency of greener technologies, such as phytoremediation and bioremediation, their use in precious metal extraction is very limited. However, this review explores several hyper-accumulating and tolerant plants viz. Brassica juncea and Berkheya coddii , which holds great potential in phytomining of precious metal from e-waste. Thus, the state of the art in precious metal extraction from e-waste as well as the advantages and disadvantages of different metal extraction technologies has been reviewed.
“Factors influencing soil microbiota functioning remain understudied. Here, the authors describe bacterial and fungal diversity across Europe and along a gradient of land-use perturbation, observing that the occurrence of pathogens, symbionts and saprotrophs varied among cropland, woodland and grassland.” Factors driving microbial community composition and diversity are well established but the relationship with microbial functioning is poorly understood, especially at large scales. We analysed microbial biodiversity metrics and distribution of potential functional groups along a gradient of increasing land-use perturbation, detecting over 79,000 bacterial and 25,000 fungal OTUs in 715 sites across 24 European countries. We found the lowest bacterial and fungal diversity in less-disturbed environments (woodlands) compared to grasslands and highly-disturbed environments (croplands). Highly-disturbed environments contain significantly more bacterial chemoheterotrophs, harbour a higher proportion of fungal plant pathogens and saprotrophs, and have less beneficial fungal plant symbionts compared to woodlands and extensively-managed grasslands. Spatial patterns of microbial communities and predicted functions are best explained when interactions among the major determinants (vegetation cover, climate, soil properties) are considered. We propose guidelines for environmental policy actions and argue that taxonomical and functional diversity should be considered simultaneously for monitoring purposes.
Illumina MiSeq is the current standard for characterizing microbial communities in soil. The newer alternative, Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION sequencer, is quickly gaining popularity because of the low initial cost and longer sequence reads. However, the accuracy of MinION, per base, is much lower than MiSeq (95% versus 99.9%). The effects of this difference in base-calling accuracy on taxonomic and diversity estimates remains unclear. We compared the effects of platform, primers, and bioinformatics on mock community and agricultural soil samples using short MiSeq, and short and full-length MinION 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. For all three methods, we found that taxonomic assignments of the mock community at both the genus and species level matched expectations with minimal deviation (genus: 80.9–90.5%; species: 70.9–85.2% Bray–Curtis similarity); however, the short MiSeq with error correction (DADA2) resulted in the correct estimate of mock community species richness and much lower alpha diversity for soils. Several filtering strategies were tested to improve these estimates with varying results. The sequencing platform also had a significant influence on the relative abundances of taxa with MiSeq resulting in significantly higher abundances Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Gemmatimonadetes and lower abundances of Acidobacteria, Bacteroides, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia compared to the MinION platform. When comparing agricultural soils from two different sites (Fort Collins, CO and Pendleton, OR), methods varied in the taxa identified as significantly different between sites. At all taxonomic levels, the full-length MinION method had the highest similarity to the short MiSeq method with DADA2 correction with 73.2%, 69.3%, 74.1%, 79.3%, 79.4%, and 82.28% of the taxa at the phyla, class, order, family, genus, and species levels, respectively, showing similar patterns in differences between the sites. In summary, although both platforms appear suitable for 16S rRNA microbial community composition, biases for different taxa may make the comparison between studies problematic; and even with a single study (i.e., comparing sites or treatments), the sequencing platform can influence the differentially abundant taxa identified.
Mismatch repair (MMR) testing on all new cases of colorectal cancer (CRC) has customarily been preferably performed on surgical specimens, as more tissue is available; however, new clinical trials for the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the neoadjuvant setting require MMR testing on biopsy samples. This study aims at identifying advantages, disadvantages and any potential pitfalls in MMR evaluation on biopsy tissue and how to cope with them. The study is prospective-retrospective, recruiting 141 biopsies (86 proficient (p)MMR and 55 deficient (d)MMR) and 97 paired surgical specimens (48 pMMR; 49 dMMR). In biopsy specimens, a high number of indeterminate stains was observed, in particular for MLH1 (31 cases, 56.4%). The main reasons were a punctate nuclear expression of MLH1, relatively weak MLH1 nuclear expression compared to internal controls, or both (making MLH1 loss difficult to interpret), which was solved by reducing primary incubation times for MLH1. A mean of  ≥﻿ 5 biopsies had adequate immunostains, compared to ≤ 3 biopsies in inadequate cases. Conversely, surgical specimens rarely suffered from indeterminate reactions, while weaker staining intensity ( p  < 0.007) for MLH1 and PMS2 and increased patchiness grade ( p  < 0.0001) were seen. Central artefacts were almost exclusive to surgical specimens. MMR status classification was possible in 92/97 matched biopsy/resection specimen cases, and all of these were concordant (47 pMMR and 45 dMMR). Evaluation of MMR status on CRC biopsy samples is feasible, if pitfalls in interpretation are known, making laboratory-specific appropriate staining protocols fundamental for high-quality diagnoses.
Multimodality treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer is the standard of care. Treatments include surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, with medical therapies now being favored in the neoadjuvant setting. Various regimens continue to be studied and defined in prospective randomized trials. The PRODIGE 23 and RAPIDO trials showed improved disease-free survival and pathologic complete response rates for split chemotherapy/radiation treatment and short-course radiation with consolidation chemotherapy, respectively; both compared with traditional neoadjuvant long course chemoradiation, surgery, and adjuvant chemotherapy. Furthermore, new regimens are yielding a higher rate of complete clinical response, allowing for non-operative management. Circulating tumor DNA provides a potential novel option for monitoring response to treatment and rectal cancer surveillance. This manuscript summarizes some of the key clinical trials and studies that are defining clinical practice.
Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate the predictive value of changes in serum uric acid (SUA), the ratio of serum uric acid to serum creatinine (SUA/SCr), and serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) from before to after therapy in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Methods Data from 114 LARC patients from January 2016 to December 2021 were included in this retrospective study. All patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) and total mesorectal excision (TME). The change in SUA was calculated as a ratio: (SUA level after nCRT–SUA level before nCRT)/SUA level before nCRT. The change ratios of SUA/SCr and GGT were calculated in the same way. The efficacy of nCRT was evaluated by magnetic resonance (MR) and postoperative pathological response. A nonlinear model was used to evaluate whether the change ratios of SUA, SUA/SCr, and GGT were associated with the efficacy of nCRT. The predictive power of the change ratios of SUA, SUA/SCr, and GGT was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were employed to measure the associations between disease-free survival (DFS) and other predictive indicators. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to further compare DFS between groups. Results The nonlinear model indicated that the change ratios of SUA, SUA/SCr, and GGT were associated with the efficacy of nCRT. The change ratios of SUA, SUA/SCr, and GGT were used to predict the area under the ROC curve of efficacy for nCRT (0.95, 0.91–0.99), which was better than the prediction by the change ratio of SUA (0.94, 0.89–0.99), SUA/SCr (0.90, 0.84–0.96), or GGT alone (0.86, 0.79–0.93; p  < 0.05). The optimal cut-off values of SUA, SUA/SCr, and GGT change were 0.02, 0.01, and 0.04, respectively. The Kaplan–Meier method indicated that patients with SUA, SUA/SCr, or GGT changes greater than the cut-off values had shorter DFS ( p  < 0.05). Conclusion Change ratios of SUA, SUA/SCr, or GGT greater than the cut-off values implied a risk of poor pathological response after nCRT and shorter DFS in LARC patients.
Effective monitoring of agricultural lands requires accurate spatial information about the locations and boundaries of agricultural fields. Through satellite imagery, such information can be mapped on a large scale at a high temporal frequency. Various methods exist in the literature for segmenting agricultural fields from satellite images. Edge-based, region-based, or hybrid segmentation methods are traditional methods that have widely been used for segmenting agricultural fields. Lately, the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) for various tasks in remote sensing has been gaining traction. Therefore, to identify the optimal method for segmenting agricultural fields from satellite images, we evaluated three state-of-the-art DNNs, namely Mask R-CNN, U-Net, and FracTAL ResUNet against the multiresolution segmentation (MRS) algorithm, which is a region-based and a more traditional segmentation method. Given that the DNNs are supervised methods, we used an optimised version of the MRS algorithm based on supervised Bayesian optimisation. Monotemporal Sentinel-2 (S2) images acquired in Lower Saxony, Germany were used in this study. Based on the agricultural parcels declared by farmers within the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) framework, the segmentation results of each method were evaluated using the F-score and intersection over union (IoU) metrics. The respective average F-score and IoU obtained by each method are 0.682 and 0.524 for Mask R-CNN, 0.781 and 0.646 for U-Net, 0.808 and 0.683 for FracTAL ResUNet, and 0.805 and 0.678 for the optimised MRS approach. This study shows that DNNs, particularly FracTAL ResUNet, can be effectively used for large-scale segmentation of agricultural fields from satellite images.
Treatments of dye contaminated waste water by conventional physico-chemical methods are less attractive due to various factors and bioremediation using natural plant-based sorbents has gained attention due to eco-friendliness and economical advantages. In this research, a natural adsorbent derived from Mangifera indica was employed to remove the dye turquoise blue. Central composite design technique was implemented to investigate the factors influencing the dye adsorption onto the activated Mangifera indica shell and their interactions. The Lasso and Ridge machine learning models were employed to optimize adsorption. The Ridge model accurately predicts the experimental data. Furthermore, a constrained nonlinear particle swarm optimization was employed to maximize the dye removal efficiency. It was observed that the maximum removal percentage of dye using this adsorbent was 87.44% under optimum operating conditions. The adsorption isotherm was best fitted by the Redlich–Peterson model in all the temperature conditions investigated. The parameter values computed from cftool kit in MATLAB are observed as k_RP = 2.4420 1/g, a_RP = 0.0474 1/mg^β, and b_RP = 1.2360 at the optimum temperature of 50 °C with an R^2 of 0.9740. The kinetic studies revealed the fit of Lagergren’s pseudo first order kinetics (k_1 = 0.1047 1/min and q_1 = 11.230 mg/g) in sorption kinetics for which the R^2 value was reported as 0.9980.
In order to improve the accuracy of the parameters needed in the discrete element method (DEM) simulation process of wet-sticky feed raw materials, the JKR contact model in DEM was used to calibrate and verify the physical parameters of wet-sticky feed raw materials. Firstly, the parameters that have a significant effect on the angle of repose were screened using a Plackett–Burman design, and the screened parameters were: MM rolling friction coefficient, MM static friction coefficient, and JKR surface energy. Then, the three screened parameters were selected as the influencing factors and the accumulation angle of repose was selected as evaluating indicator; thus, the performance optimization experiments were carried out with the quadratic orthogonal rotation design. Taking the experimentally measured angle of repose value of 54.25°as the target value, the significance parameters were optimized, and the optimal combination was obtained : MM rolling friction factor was 0.21, MM static friction factor was 0.51, and JKR surface energy was 0.65. Finally, the angle of repose and SPP tests were compared under the calibrated parameters. The results showed that the relative error of experimental and simulated tests in angle of repose was 0.57%, and the compression displacement and compression ratio of the experimental and simulated tests in SPP were 1.01% and 0.95%, respectively, which improved the reliability of the simulated results. The research findings provide a reference basis for simulation study and optimal design of related equipment for feed raw materials.
Biscuits contain high proportions of saturated fats, which could lead to an adverse health effect. The objective of this study was to study the functionality of a complex nanoemulsion (CNE), stabilised with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and lecithin, when used as a saturated fat replacer in short dough biscuits. Four biscuit formulations were studied including a control (butter) and three formulations where 33% of the butter was replaced with either extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), with CNE, or with the individual ingredients of the nanoemulsion added separately (INE). The biscuits were evaluated by texture analysis, microstructural characterisation, and quantitative descriptive analysis by a trained sensory panel. The results showed that incorporation of CNE and INE yielded doughs and biscuits with significantly higher ( p  < 0.05) hardness and fracture strength values than the control. The doughs made of CNE and INE showed significantly less oil migration during the storage than EVOO formulations, which was confirmed by the confocal images. The trained panel did not find significant differences in crumb density and hardness on the first bite among CNE, INE and the control. In conclusion, nanoemulsions stabilised with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and lecithin can work as saturated fat replacers in short dough biscuits, providing satisfactory physical characteristics and sensory attributes.
With the development of nanotechnology and its application in various sciences, scientists have investigated the use of nanoparticles as adsorbents to remove heavy metals from aqueous solutions all over the world. So far, the results of many of these studies have been published in reputable journals. Obviously, reviewing these articles and summarizing the results of these studies from different aspects will provide new perspectives for the development of this technology for heavy metals removal from water. So the current study was performed to review the results of the published studies between 1/January/1980 to 1/January/2022. The focus of the study is on the analysis of these studies and their classification. In addition, a more detailed investigation was carried out. Among the 5155 articles, 576 articles were included based on Cochrane protocols. Results show that most of the studies (90.8%) were conducted on a laboratory scale and used synthetic solutions. Most studies were performed for Pb, Cd and Cu, removal respectively. Compared to other countries, authors with affiliation from China and Iran have published more articles. The ranking of the use of various nanomaterials were: nanocomposites > metal oxide nanomaterials > metal-based nanomaterials > carbon-based nanomaterials > dendrimers, with the wide range of sizes from less than 10 nm to several hundreds of nanometers. The required amount of carbon-based nanoparticles to remove many heavy metals were lower than other nanoparticles. In most studies, pH ≤ 7 has been reported as optimal. Most studies have been followed pseudo second-order and pseudo first-order reactions and have been more agreement with Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms respectively. The results of studies show that the synthesis and optimization of new nanomaterials can be considered as a new and competitive technology. However, more studies are needed to investigate the removal of heavy metals in real samples and to overcome some challenges in the full-scale application.
The presence of heavy metals (HM) and trace elements (TE) in soil and rice can be either beneficial or harmful. Hence, assessment of the HM and TE present in them is of prime importance for proper health risk management. As a first-hand report, an assessment of the TE and HM in paddy fields and rice grains was undertaken to evaluate health-related issues after consuming local rice grains from Champhai, North Vanlaiphai, and Kolasib of Mizoram, India. The concentrations of TE and HM in paddy fields could be ranked in the order Fe > Zn > Mn > Cu > Ni > As, and no trace amounts of Cd and Pb were found. In soils and rice, all the elements were determined to be below permitted limits. A significant difference ( p  < 0.05) was found when the concentration of HM and TE in the soil and rice were compared. The Health Risk Index (HRI) value of rice consumers for all the study sites was less than 1 in all cases except for Ni from Champhai rice (1.6) suggesting cultivars from Champhai might pose some negative impacts on health and sought for better management system.
Introduction Cross-sectional imaging plays an integral role in the management of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer, from initial diagnosis and staging to determining appropriate treatment strategies. Subjective imaging interpretation has known limitations. The field of radiomics has evolved to extract quantitative data from medical imaging and relate these to biological processes. The key concept behind radiomics is that the high-throughput analysis of quantitative imaging features can provide predictive or prognostic information, with the goal of providing individualised care. Objective Radiomic studies have shown promising utility in upper gastrointestinal oncology, highlighting a potential role in determining stage of disease and degree of tumour differentiation and predicting recurrence-free survival. This narrative review aims to provide an insight into the concepts underpinning radiomics, as well as its potential applications for guiding treatment and surgical decision-making in upper gastrointestinal malignancy. Conclusion Outcomes from studies to date have been promising; however, further standardisation and collaboration are required. Large prospective studies with external validation and evaluation of radiomic integration into clinical pathways are needed. Future research should now focus on translating the promising utility of radiomics into meaningful patient outcomes.
Background Size and number of lymph nodes (LNs) were reported to be associated with the prognosis of stage II colorectal cancer (CRC). The purpose of this study was to determine the prognostic role of the size of LNs (SLNs) measured by computer tomography (CT) and the number of retrieved LNs (NLNs) in the relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) among stage II CRC patients. Methods Consecutive patients diagnosed with stage II CRC at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (FUSCC) from January 2011 to December 2015 were reviewed, and 351 patients were randomly divided into two cohorts for cross-validation. The optimal cut-off values were obtained using X-tile program. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analyses were conducted for the two cohorts. Results Data from 351 stage II CRC patients were analyzed. The cut-off values for SLNs and NLNs were 5.8 mm and 22, respectively, determined by the X-tile in the training cohort. In the validation cohort, Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated SLNs (P = 0.0034) and NLNs (P = 0.0451) were positively correlated with RFS but not with OS. The median follow-up time in the training cohort and the validation cohort were 60.8 months and 61.0 months respectively. Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that both SLNs (training cohort: Hazard Ratio (HR) = 2.361, 95% Confidence interval (CI): 1.044–5.338, P = 0.039; validation cohort: HR = 2.979, 95%CI: 1.435–5.184, P = 0.003) and NLNs (training cohort: HR = 0.335, 95%CI: 0.113–0.994, P = 0.049; validation cohort: HR = 0.375, 95%CI: 0.156-0.900, P = 0.021) were independent prognostic factors for RFS whereas not for OS. Conclusion SLNs and NLNs are independent prognostic factors for patients with stage II CRC. Patients with SLNs > 5.8 mm and NLNs ≤ 22 are apt to have higher risk of recurrence.
The fullness of rice seeds is an important factor affecting the growth and yield of rice. Therefore, it is of great significance to detect fullness of rice seeds in nature state. In this paper, the emerging terahertz imaging detection technology is used to carry out the study of rice seed fullness detection. Firstly, the terahertz spectral images of rice seeds with different fullness are acquired. Secondly, the terahertz spectra of sample free region, empty shell seed region, and full seed region are extracted, respectively. To improve the accuracy of the model and reduce the computational effort, competitive adaptive reweighting sampling (CARS), uninformative variable elimination (UVE), Successive projection algorithm (SPA), and their combination are used to extract the features of terahertz spectral information. The corresponding support vector machine (SVM) and K -nearest neighbor (KNN) qualitative discriminant models are established to detect and identify the full and empty regions of rice seeds. In addition, the binarization of terahertz image is carried out to realize the visual expression of rice seeds. The UVE-SPA-KNN model established after band screening is used for classification, and the accuracy of prediction set reaches 98.33%. The UVE-SPA feature extraction method can reduce the amount of imaging data by 97.5% and realizes the visualization detection of kernels in rice seeds. This research verified that the visual detection of seed kernel fullness inside rice seeds can be well achieved by using terahertz imaging and spectrum fusion, which provides a new method for rapid detection of kernel fullness of rice seeds, and also provides a theoretical reference for terahertz imaging technology to detect the fullness of other thin-shell seeds. 1. In this paper, three different spectra of different sample free region, empty shell seed region and full seed region in 0.5–3.0 THz image are extracted, and five band screening methods of CARS, UVE, SPA, CARS-SPA and UVE-SPA are used to extract the characteristic wavelength of the THz spectral. 2. The discriminant model is established to distinguish between background region, empty shell seed region and full seed region. The research shows that the established UVE-SPA-KNN qualitative discriminant model has a recognition rate of up to 98.33%. 3. The fullness of rice seeds is calculated by the ratio of binarization and shell-kernel pixel points of 0.5–3.0 THz images, the 150 threshold is used for shell in channel B, and the 235 threshold is used for kernel in channel R in the process of image binarization. The error between the detection fullness of rice seeds and the actual fullness is less than 10%. 4. In order to reduce the amount of imaging data and remove redundant information, the UVE-SPA feature extraction method is further used to compress the full spectrum of 329 wavelengths into 8 wavelengths, which reduces the amount of imaging data by 97.5% and can also realize the visualization detection of kernels in rice seeds.

Macroalgae are one of various groups of multicellular algae include some types of Rhodophyta (red), Phaeophyta (brown), and Chlorophyta (green) macroalgae. They are now a source for biorefineries, as they contribute to energy production as biomass. Algae are worth noting because of their high content in compounds with separate biological activities, including agar, agarose, and carrageenan in red algae; alginates, laminarin, and fucoidan in brown algae; and ulvan, sulfated galactans, and xylans in green algae. Skeletal polysaccharides of red algae are composed of cellulose 1,β-1,3-mannan and β-1,4-acrylic acid. More than half of the dry weight of brown algae is made up of the polysaccharides alginate, laminarin, and fucoidan, and this percentage can even exceed 70% in some species. They are converted to monosaccharides that can be easily used by using polysaccharide hydrolysis enzymes. This process has the potential to maximize biofuel yields. Compared with the enzymatic depolymerization of brown and red algae polysaccharides, the depolymerization of green algae polysaccharides has been less extensively investigated. However, the use of ulvan lyase is very promising because it can degrade ulvan with good specificity, high efficiency, and mild reaction conditions, and it can well maintain the rare sugar structure properties of ulvan. The depolymerization process of macroalgae by chemical hydrolysis requires high cost, causes environmental pollution, and has limited use due to problems such as low yield. Therefore, an environmentally friendly, energy efficient and economical enzymatic depolymerization process of macroalgae using degrading enzyme will be needed.
The objective of this work was to characterize the produced activated carbons based on Phoenix dactylifera rachis (date palm rachis: RP) using steam with different burn-off values (45, 55, and 65%), and then use those carbons to eliminate BEZAKTIV Red S-MAX (RS), a commercial textile dye. The characterization of the carbons was carried out by analyzing N_2 adsorption–desorption, SEM, FTIR, TGA/SM, Boehm titration, and pH_PZC. The specific surface area S_2D-NLDFT was 500, 646, and 507 m^2/g for the activated carbons PRAC45, PRAC55, and PRAC65, respectively. The Box–Behnken design (BBD) of experiments was applied to determine the influence of burn-off (A), initial concentration (B), and pH of the solution (C) for the RS dye elimination from the aqueous system. The significant interactions between the factors were AB and BC with p -value < 0.05. The RS dye adsorption experiments were examined by applying the kinetic and isotherm models and by studying temperature and pH effect. It was found that the RS adsorption followed the pseudo-second-order ( R ^2 > 0.99) and the removal data were well fitted to the Langmuir isotherm model. The Langmuir maximum adsorption capacity Q _m of RS dye was 198 mg/g for PRAC55. The regeneration of the carbons using thermal treatment was tested, and it revealed that the specific surface area S_2D-NLDFT and the RS adsorption capacity Q _m increased after the regeneration to 965 m^2/g and 56.3 mg/g, respectively, for PRAC55. The Phoenix dactylifera rachis adsorbents could eliminate industrial wastewater (IW) which contains BEZAKTIV dyes with an adsorption rate superior to 55%. Graphical abstract 
Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbioses in plants are broadly significant because of their capacity to facilitate water and nutrient acquisition and thus, to promote vigorous growth and development among host plants. Many horticultural plants, especially citrus plants, are highly dependent on AM fungi. In return, AM fungi receive sugars and lipids from their host plants. The sugars (mainly sucrose) are transported from the aerial parts of host plants to the roots and thus, form a mycorrhizal carbon pool. In roots, sucrose is converted to hexoses, which are then taken up by AM fungal intraradical hyphae and converted to trehalose and glycogen for growth and storage in extraradical hyphae and potentially participate in the soil carbon cycle through as the glomalin-related soil proteins. Therefore, the root mycorrhizal carbon pool influences the sugar (mainly sucrose) metabolism of plants, providing a guarantee for mycorrhizal plants to maintain better plant growth, stress resistance, fruit quality, lateral root development, and soil carbon sequestration. Thus, sugar metabolism is a player in the dialog between AM fungi and plants. This review briefly summarizes the processes of sucrose synthesis, transport, and metabolism, and highlights the relationship between AM fungi and plant sugars with an emphasis on AM-carbon pools, osmotic adjustment, fruit quality, and sugar-associated gene expression. Future research prospects are discussed.
The global agricultural system has been badly affected by adverse environmental changes in the past few years. These changes, including the rise of abiotic and biotic stressors negatively altered the growth and physiology of crop plants. Abiotic stresses, such as salinity, temperature extremes, drought, and heavy metals/metalloids, are major environmental constraints limiting crop growth, productivity, and sustainability worldwide. These stresses adversely affect plant metabolic activities and redox homeostasis, eventually leading to a reduction in plant growth and development. Plant growth regulators (PGRs) play a key role in regulating plants developmental processes and defensive responses under adverse environmental conditions. Among PGRs, gibberellic acid ( GA_3), an endogenous tetracyclic diterpenoid plant hormone, regulates many growth and developmental aspects of crop plants. GA_3 plays a pivotal role in mitigating abiotic stresses induced-perturbations in plants by modulating various physio-biochemical and molecular processes. Based on recent reports, this review article describes the role of exogenously applied GA_3 in improving seed germination, phenotypic characteristics, metabolic processes, yield and quality components, and post-harvest life of fruits, vegetables, and flowers. In this article, we summarize research concerning GA_3 biosynthesis and signaling and discuss the potential role of GA_3 in mediating tolerance to various abiotic stresses. Moreover, the present article enlightens the current research concerning the signaling pathway in gibberellin and gibberellin-mediated crosstalk with other plant hormones.
Intensive fertilization of vegetables can promote phosphorus (P) toxicity. However, it can be reversed using silicon (Si), although there is a lack of research clarifying its mechanisms of action. This research aims to study the damage caused by P toxicity to scarlet eggplant plants and whether Si can mitigate this toxicity. We evaluated the nutritional and physiological aspects of plants. Treatments were arranged in a 2 × 2 factorial design of two nutritional levels of adequate P (2 mmol L^−1 of P) and toxic/excess P (8 to 13 mmol L^−1 of P) combined with the absence or presence of nanosilica (2 mmol L^−1 Si) in a nutrient solution. There were six replications. The excess P in the nutrient solution caused damage to scarlet eggplant growth due to nutritional losses and oxidative stress. We found that P toxicity can be mitigated by supplying Si, which decreases P uptake by 13%, improves C:N homeostasis, and increases iron (Fe), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) use efficiency by 21%, 10%, and 12%, respectively. At the same time, it decreases oxidative stress and electrolyte leakage by 18% and increases antioxidant compounds (phenols and ascorbic acid by 13% and 50%, respectively), and decreases photosynthetic efficiency and plant growth by 12% (by increasing 23% and 25% of shoot and root dry mass, respectively). These findings allow us to explain the different Si mechanisms used to reverse the damage caused by P toxicity to plants.
In the present work, the interactions and associations between low denatured pea globulins (PPI) and purified main egg white proteins (ovalbumin (OVA), ovotransferrin (OVT), and lysozyme (LYS)) were studied at pH 7.5 and 9.0 by using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), dynamic light scattering (DLS), laser granulometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). From ITC, we detected strong exothermic interactions between PPI and LYS at both pHs, which led to aggregation. At these pH values, the net positive charge of lysozyme favored electrostatic interactions with negative charges of pea proteins, and oligomers were formed during titration experiments. Furthermore, DLS, laser granulometry, and CLSM data showed that the particle size of the mixture increased with increasing LYS to PPI molar ratio (from 0.8 to 20). Large irregular aggregates up to 20–25 μm were formed at high molar ratios and no complex coacervate was observed. No or very weak interactions were detected between OVT or OVA and PPI whatever the pH. These results suggest the role of electrostatic interactions between LYS and PPI when considering protein mixtures.
Pre-processes such as blanching, which cause time, labor and economic losses, are carried out to remove the peel bitterness during bitter orange ( Citrus aurantium ) jam production. During these processes, many flavonoids and tannins in the fruit peel are lost. In this study, it was aimed to mask the bitterness without blanching of the peel by using carob syrup in different concentrations (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) instead of granulated sugar. Samples were examined in terms of compositional properties (pH, titratable acidity, Brixº, moisture, total sugar and crude fiber contents), total phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity, color (L*, a*, b*) and sensory properties (appearance, color, odor, texture, taste, bitterness, fluidity). The interaction of gallic acid and tannic acid with naringin was also analyzed sensorially and spectrophotometrically to determine the source masking the bitterness. As a result, the total sugar content of jams reduced and the crude fiber, total phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity increased with use of carob syrup. The use of carob syrup also improved the sensory properties of the jams such as brightness, texture, odor, taste and bitterness. In particular, no bitterness was detected in jams produced with 100% carob syrup. Thus, it was observed that the bitterness from the bitter orange peel could be masked by using only carob syrup without the need for blanching. It was determined that phenolic compounds (especially gallic acid) found in high amounts in carob syrup formed a complex with naringin, which causes bitterness, so naringin was suppressed and bitterness was masked.
Radiologic imaging, especially MRI, has long been the mainstay for rectal cancer staging and patient selection for neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgical resection. In contrast, colonoscopy and CT have been the standard for colon cancer diagnosis and metastasis staging with T and N staging often performed at the time of surgical resection. With recent clinical trials exploring the expansion of the use of neoadjuvant therapy beyond the anorectum to the remainder of the colon, the current and future state of colon cancer treatment is evolving with a renewed interest in evaluating the role radiology may play in the primary T staging of colon cancer. The performance of CT, CT colonography, MRI, and FDG PET-CT for colon cancer staging will be reviewed. N staging will also be briefly discussed. It is expected that accurate radiologic T staging will significantly impact future clinical decisions regarding the neoadjuvant versus surgical management of colon cancer.
The associations of physical activity (PA) with body composition among persons with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) are not well described. The objective was to investigate associations of PA with visceral fat mass and percentage body fat in persons with PsA of different age groups. Persons with PsA (CASPAR criteria, n = 356), and controls (n = 47,470) from the Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT4, 2017–2019) were included. Visceral fat mass and percentage body fat measured using bioelectrical impedance were primary outcomes in multivariable linear regression analysis. PsA, PA (questionnaire data), and age were explanatory variables, with adjustment for sex, smoking, heart disease, lung disease, and height. An interaction term between PsA and age was included in both models. Persons with PsA had altered body composition, including higher visceral fat mass and percentage body fat, especially those < 40 years of age (p ≤ 0.01). Moderate or high PA was associated with significantly lower values of the primary outcomes. Differences were Moderate compared to low PA: 1.4 kg (95% CI 1.3, 1.5 kg) lower visceral fat mass, and 2.0% (95% CI 1.8, 2.1) lower percentage body fat. Differences were High compared to low PA: 3.2 kg (95% CI 3.1, 3.3) lower visceral fat mass and 5.0% (95% CI 4.8, 5.1%) lower percentage body fat. Persons with PsA had higher visceral fat mass and percentage body fat, especially if < 40 years, and PA was associated with lower values of both endpoints. Changes of body composition in persons with PsA may influence important health outcomes and should be addressed in clinical practice.
Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs) are important nutrients for human health. We aimed to evaluate the efficiency of marine water fungus Aspergillus sp. (Accession no: MZ505709) for lipid biosynthesis. The Yeast Extract Glucose (YEG) medium was supplemented with different concentration of Borassus flabellifer Endocarps Hydrolysate (BFEH; 1–5%) to evaluate the fungal biomass and its lipid accumulation. The combination of glucose and BFEH as carbon source increased the fresh weight (25.43 ± 0.33 g/L), dry weight (21.39 ± 0.77 g/L) and lipid yield (3.14 ± 0.09 g/L) of fungal biomass. The lipid content of dried fungal biomass has shown 91.08 ± 5.07 mg cod liver oil equivalents/g and 125.98 ± 5.96 mg groundnut oil equivalents/g biomass. GC-MS and NMR spectrometry analysis revealed the compounds involved in fatty acid metabolism and lipid signaling pathways along with the presence of linolenic acid. Interestingly, fungus grown in BFEH enriched medium has recorded the maximum amount of lipids with major fatty acid derivatives. Increase in the growth rate of Artemia franciscana was observed, when the extracted fungal lipid was supplemented as a food supplement. Therefore, this study suggests that marine fungal lipid may serve as potential natural compound as nutraceuticals and aquafeeds.
The indirect effects of adopting the EAT– Lancet diet in the wider economy—and what this means for key social and environmental indicators—require further exploration. Using a general equilibrium model and tracing physical biomass, this study reveals spillover effects of a dietary shift on food prices, wages, trade, land use, biomass production and greenhouse gas emissions. Dietary shifts are key for enhancing the sustainability of current food systems but need to account for potential economic, social and environmental indirect effects as well. By tracing physical quantities of biomass along supply chains in a global economic model, we investigate the benefits of adopting the EAT– Lancet diet and other social, economic and environmental spillovers in the wider economy. We find that decreased global food demand reduces global biomass production, food prices, trade, land use and food loss and waste but also reduces food affordability for low-income agricultural households. In sub-Saharan Africa, increased food demand and higher prices decrease food affordability also for non-agricultural households. Economic spillovers into non-food sectors limit agricultural land and greenhouse gas reductions as cheaper biomass is demanded more for non-food use. From an environmental perspective, economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions increase as lower global food demand at lower prices frees income subsequently spent on non-food items.
To reduce nutrient losses from the food system, it is necessary to improve biomass management and foster change. Such a change is often hindered by a lack of stakeholder interaction. Therefore, a qualitative case study and a practical application of the innovation platform approach in the Dutch-German border region Rhine-Waal were carried out to determine challenges and opportunities in the agro-food-waste system towards circular nutrient management in a nutrient-saturated and intensive animal production-dominated localized area. Twenty-one actors participated in a half-day workshop. A bottom-up approach was chosen as it increases trust between stakeholders and supports the acceptance of research processes. This study identified opportunities and challenges perceived by stakeholders participating in the innovation platform approach to facilitate a transition towards local circular nutrient management. We observed that challenges and opportunities exist at three levels: the individual actor’s level, the system level and the interconnection of the system with its wider environment. With a variety of stakeholders from animal and crop production to the food processing industry being present in the study area, the current demand and supply of biomass is very diverse. This diversity has been identified as a distinct opportunity for the establishment of a biomass exchange network in the area. However, information on demand and supply of nutrients between actors is currently scattered and information sharing hindered by the lack of direct monetary benefits. The lessons learned using the innovation platform approach are a first step towards improving nutrient circularity at a localized scale in nutrient-saturated areas.
Rice, one of the major food crops worldwide, has a crucial position in the health and development of society. However, Hg bioconcentrated through rice may cause hazards to consumers due to exposure to Hg from anthropogenic as well as natural sources, although the risk level depends on the chemical form of Hg in rice grains. To clarify the transformation and transport of Hg in rice-field systems, the processes and mechanisms of Hg uptake by rice, and the factors that affect uptake are considered critical for the development of potential alleviation strategies. Therefore, this review first briefly introduced Hg species in rice soils; then, the pathways of Hg uptake by rice and the endogenous and environmental factors affecting the uptake were deeply approached, to elucidate the mechanisms. Finally, the bioconcentration and distribution patterns of Hg in various tissues of rice were summarized. This will provide an effective reference for the development of reasonable and effective Hg pollution control strategies in the future.
Intercropping leguminous plant species with non-legume crops could be an effective strategy to maintain soil fertility. Additionally, the application of nano-Zn and Fe in trace amounts can substantially improve the bioavailable fraction of Zn and Fe. We studied the effect of foliar application of some nanomaterials on the agronomic, physio-biochemical attributes under a radish/pea intercropping system. The radish and pea were sprayed with different nanomaterials (Zn–Fe nanocomposite, n ZnO, and nanobiochar) at 0 and 50 mg L^-1 concentrations. Results indicated that the growth parameters of radish were higher in intercropping than in monocropping, while pea growth was inhibited in intercropping compared with monocropping. The shoot and root length, fresh weight, and dry matter of radish were increased by 28–50%, 60–70%, and 50–56% by intercropping than monocropping. Foliar spray of nano-materials further increased the growth traits of intercropped radish, such as shoot and root length, fresh weight, and dry matter, by 7–8%, 27–41%, and 50–60%, respectively. Similarly, pigments such as chlorophyll a , b , and carotenoids and the concentration of free amino acids, soluble sugars, flavonoids, and phenolics were differentially affected by intercropping and nanomaterials. The yield of the non-legume crop was increased by intercropping, whereas the legume crop exhibited significant growth inhibition due to competitive interactions. In conclusion, both intercropping and foliar spray of nanomaterials could be used as a combined approach to benefit plant growth and enhance the bioavailable Fe and Zn fractions of both crops.
Carboxylic acids have become interesting platform molecules in the last years due to their versatility to act as carbon sources for different microorganisms or as precursors for the chemical industry. Among carboxylic acids, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as acetic, propionic, butyric, valeric, and caproic acids can be biotechnologically produced in an anaerobic fermentation process from lignocellulose or other organic wastes of agricultural, industrial, or municipal origin. The biosynthesis of SCFAs is advantageous compared to chemical synthesis, since the latter relies on fossil-derived raw materials, expensive and toxic catalysts and harsh process conditions. This review article gives an overview on biosynthesis of SCFAs from complex waste products. Different applications of SCFAs are explored and how these acids can be considered as a source of bioproducts, aiming at the development of a circular economy. The use of SCFAs as platform molecules requires adequate concentration and separation processes that are also addressed in this review. Various microorganisms such as bacteria or oleaginous yeasts can efficiently use SCFA mixtures derived from anaerobic fermentation, an attribute that can be exploited in microbial electrolytic cells or to produce biopolymers such as microbial oils or polyhydroxyalkanoates. Promising technologies for the microbial conversion of SCFAs into bioproducts are outlined with recent examples, highlighting SCFAs as interesting platform molecules for the development of future bioeconomy.
In agriculture, the selection of healthy and vigorous seeds is critical, so seeds must be of high quality. Seed priming is a reliable and commercial strategy for improving seed germination and seedling establishment under stressful conditions, whether biotic or abiotic. Heat stress occurs when temperature rises above a particular point and results in permanent irreversible damage to plants, whereas, heat stress that primarily affects crops during their reproductive or grain-filling stages, is referred as terminal heat stress. The present experiment deals with treating two varieties of wheat (HUW-468: Temperature sensitive and HUW-510: Temperature resistant) using boric acid and borax as priming agents and evaluating their effect on different parameters including biochemical (Hydrogen peroxide, Malondialdehyde, and Proline) and antioxidant parameters (Superoxide dismutase, Catalase, Ascorbate peroxidase, and Glutathione reductase) by sowing them under two different conditions (Timely and Late sown) for evaluating effect of priming agents on heat stress on different days of study. The results obtained indicate that primed seedlings grew better and were more resilient to stress, and this was due in part to lower ROS production, stronger membrane stability, a strong antioxidant defense system, and preservation of a strong and healthy crop stand.
Understanding the genetic variability of hybrids provides information on their current and future evolutionary role. In this paper, we focus on the interspecific hybrid Ranunculus circinatus  ×  R. fluitans that forms spontaneously within the group Ranuculus L. sect. Batrachium DC. (Ranunculaceae Juss.). Genome-wide DNA fingerprinting using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) was employed to determine the genetic variation among 36 riverine populations of the hybrid and their parental species. The results demonstrate a strong genetic structure of R. circinatus  ×  R. fluitans within Poland (Central Europe), which is attributed to independent hybridization events, sterility of hybrid individuals, vegetative propagation, and isolation through geographical distance within populations. The hybrid R. circinatus  ×  R. fluitans is a sterile triploid, but, as we have shown in this study, it may participate in subsequent hybridization events, resulting in a ploidy change that can lead to spontaneous fertility recovery. The ability to produce unreduced female gametes of the hybrid R. circinatus  ×  R. fluitans and the parental species R. fluitans is an important evolutionary mechanism in Ranunculus sect. Batrachium that could give rise to new taxa.
Abiotic stresses are the most major limitation to crop production, causing yield losses up to 50%, and consider the major challenges for production of crops. Thus, an experiment was conducted to determine how sugar beet would respond to soil application of K-humate rates and foliar application of biostimulants under salt stress. Split-plot design in three replicates was used in both seasons, where K-humate rates fertigation (control, 12, and 24 kg ha^−1) allocated in the main plots, and different foliar application of BS arranged within the subplot (i.e., (1) water spray, (2) salicylic acid (SA) at the rate of 100 mg L^−1, (3) fulvic acid (FA) at the rate of 1.2 kg ha^−1, (4) hydroxyproline (HP) 1000 mg L^−1, (5) SA at 100 mg L^−1 + FA at 1.2 kg ha^−1, (6) SA at 100 mg/L + HP at 1000 mg L^−1, (7) FA at 1.2 kg ha^−1 + HP at 1000 mg L^−1, (8) SA 100 mg L^−1 + FA 1.2 kg ha^−1 + HP 1000 mg L^−1) in the two seasons. The finding results revealed that soil application of K-humate, foliar application of BS, and their interaction significantly affected yield, growth, and quality characteristics of sugar beet under soil salinity, furthermore with soil application of K-humate at the rate of 24 kg ha^−1 with foliar spray of FA + HP recorded the highest of growth traits, top, root, sucrose %, sugar yields/ha^−1 and the lowest values of Na content in the juice and quality of sugar beet under the study conditions, Alexandria, Egypt.
Cucurbits are an important crop grown across peri-urban, coastal and inland regions of New South Wales, Australia. Viral infection is a persistent issue across cucurbit commodities, different production methods and production regions. In this study, 34 cucurbit growing properties across five production regions of New South Wales were surveyed and sampled repeatedly from 2018 to 2021. Samples were tested for the presence of known endemic viruses using both serological and molecular diagnostic methods. Viral pathogens were detected on 22 of the 34 properties sampled, and in 44% of samples tested. Annual disease incidence ranged from 0 to 90%, typically increasing towards the end of the summer growing season. Papaya ringspot virus, watermelon mosaic virus, and cucumber mosaic virus, were identified as the most frequently detected viruses. Melon necrotic spot virus and beet pseudo yellows virus were detected at low rates. Cases of mixed infections of papaya ringspot virus and watermelon mosaic virus were also detected in some samples. Furthermore, cucumber green mottle mosaic virus, a “notifiable disease”, was detected for the first time in New South Wales. A newly described virus, watermelon crinkle leaf associated virus-1, was also detected using next- generation sequencing technology. The latter two virus records represent a geographic range expansion and first report for Australia respectively.
Herbicide residue contamination is a serious threat to crop growth and farmland ecology in agricultural soil. Biochar is often assumed to minimize herbicide residues; nevertheless, research on the possible effects of biochar on herbicides is minimal. This research examined the mechanism underlying how biochar-based therapy reduces sugar beet pesticide residues. The current study was conducted to investigate the effect of biochar [0, 0.5, 1, and 2% ( w / w )] on the morphophysiology of sugar beet and the properties of soil under fomesafen stress. Fomesafen residue negatively affected the growth of sugar beet due to the change in soil properties. However, our investigation revealed that biochar at 0.5–2% reduced fomesafen residues in soil by 29.06–46.05%. Moreover, biochar enhanced soil physicochemical properties and enhanced soil enzyme activities, with 1% biochar raising pH by (3.49%) and soil water content (SWC) by (13.85%), compared to fomesafen residue treatment alone. Similarly, the available nitrogen (AN), available potassium (AK), and soil organic matter (SOM) all increased by 9.68%, 17.71%, and 11.85%. Furthermore, using biochar increases morphological growth and development, photosynthetic contents and properties, and chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics of sugar beet seedlings, while decreasing electrolyte permeability (EL) by 53.23–64.79% and malondialdehyde (MDA) by 25.75–54.4% under herbicide residue. Consequently, biochar can reduce the residual amount of fomesafen in the soil, thus reducing the toxicity of fomesafen to sugar beets by improving soil characteristics. The present study indicates that applying biochar could be an effective technique to mitigate herbicide contamination.
Objectives To compare four previously published methods for rectal tumor response evaluation after chemoradiotherapy on MRI. Methods Twenty-two radiologists (5 rectal MRI experts, 17 general/abdominal radiologists) retrospectively reviewed the post-chemoradiotherapy MRIs of 90 patients, scanned at 10 centers (with non-standardized protocols). They applied four response methods; two based on T2W-MRI only (MRI tumor regression grade (mrTRG); split-scar sign), and two based on T2W-MRI+DWI (modified-mrTRG; DWI-patterns). Image quality was graded using a 0–6-point score (including slice thickness and in-plane resolution; sequence angulation; DWI b-values, signal-to-noise, and artefacts); scores < 4 were classified below average. Mixed model linear regression was used to calculate average sensitivity/specificity/accuracy to predict a complete response (versus residual tumor) and assess the impact of reader experience and image quality. Group interobserver agreement (IOA) was calculated using Krippendorff’s alpha. Readers were asked to indicate their preferred scoring method(s). Results Average sensitivity/specificity/accuracy was 57%/64%/62% (mrTRG), 36%/79%/66% (split-scar), 40%/79%/67% (modified-mrTRG), and 37%/82%/68% (DWI-patterns); mrTRG showed higher sensitivity but lower specificity and accuracy ( p < 0.001) compared to the other methods. IOA was lower for the split scar method (0.18 vs. 0.39–0.43). Higher reader experience had a significant positive effect on diagnostic performance and IOA (except for the split scar sign); below-average imaging quality had a significant negative effect on diagnostic performance. DWI pattern was selected as the preferred method by 73% of readers. Conclusions Methods incorporating DWI showed the most favorable results when combining diagnostic performance, IOA, and reader preference. Reader experience and image quality clearly impacted diagnostic performance emphasizing the need for state-of-the-art imaging and dedicated radiologist training. Key Points • In a multireader study comparing 4 MRI methods for rectal tumor response evaluation, those incorporating DWI showed the best results when combining diagnostic performance, IOA, and reader preference. • The most preferred method (by 73% of readers) was the “DWI patterns” approach with an accuracy of 68%, high specificity of 82%, and group IOA of 0.43. • Reader experience level and MRI quality had an evident effect on diagnostic performance and IOA.
Über die vergangenen 20 Jahre hinweg hat die Magnetresonanztomographie (MRT) beim Rektumkarzinom stetig an Bedeutung gewonnen und nimmt heute entscheidenden Einfluss auf moderne Therapiestrategien. Sowohl im Primärstaging als auch im Restaging entkoppelt sich die Methode zunehmend vom TNM-System und nimmt die Rolle eines Gamechangers ein, indem sie morphologische und funktionelle Merkmale identifiziert, die ihrerseits High- und Low-risk-Patienten definieren. Zu den morphologischen Aspekten zählen neben der Bedrohung der mesorektalen Faszie die extramurale vaskuläre Infiltration, Tumordeposits und das muzinöse Karzinom. Unter die funktionellen Parameter fallen Zellularität und Vaskularisationsgrad. Die kombinierte Betrachtung von Morphologie und Funktion verbessert die Differenzierung von Respondern und Nonrespondern, ermöglicht eine exakte Operationsplanung, intensivierte Strahlentherapie und eine Watch-and-wait-Strategie. Over the last two decades, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has continuously been gaining influence in modern management of rectal cancer. Bringing morphological and functional features together improves the differentiation of responders from nonresponders, provides for accurate surgical planning, intensified radiation therapy regimes, and watch-and-wait strategies. A shift from TNM staging towards risk stratification of rectal cancer patients, patient selection to increasingly individualized therapies, and intensified surveillance has contributed to the transformation of rectal MRI into a true gamechanger.
In relation to the current climate change scenario, an increasing demand for research about forest biomass and/or carbon stock assessment through general allometric equation has been evident especially in tropical areas, which include the Ethiopian forests too. In Ethiopia, the majority of the natural forests that reflect large reservoirs of carbon are found in the moist southwest forests of the country as in for instance Sele-Nono forest, and estimating this biomass/carbon stock would influence the country to revise its forest policy. However, most of the allometric equations were developed based on data collected far from the southwest forests of the country; and hence may be a source of error in biomass and carbon stock estimation. Thus, this study was conducted aiming to validate the possible allometric equation for Sele-Nono forest so as to minimize the uncertainty that might be introduced due to the choice of the allometric models. For this purpose, a total of 30 plant individuals (10 trees, 5 palms, 5 fern trees, 5 lianas, and 5 bamboos) were used in this study for relevant data collection following the recommendation of Walker et al. (Standard operating procedures for terrestrial carbon measurement. Version 2012. Winrock International, USA). Regression graphs, paired t test, and cross-validation statistics were used for data analysis. The results showed that Chave et al. (Glob Change Biol 20:3177–3190, 2014) model was the more accurate model for estimating the biomass of trees in the Sele-Nono forest as compared to the local equations developed by the woody biomass project in Ethiopia and the general allometric equations developed for moist trees of tropical forest. Lianas were found to be better estimated using Schnitzer et al. (Biotropica 38:581–591, 2006), whereas Palms, highland bamboos ( Arundinaria alpina ), and fern trees ( Cyathea manniana ) were better estimated using Tiepolo et al. (Extension Serie Taiwan Forestry Research Institute 153:98–115, 2002), Mulatu and Fetene (Ethiop J Biol Sci 12:1–23, 2013), and Stanley et al. (The climate action project research initiative. Paper Presented at the Second Annual Conference on Carbon Sequestration, Arlington, 2003) models, respectively (Bias ≤ 10%). Based on the findings of our study we recommend that the biomass equations proposed by Chave et al. (Glob Change Biol 20:3177–3190, 2014), Tiepolo et al. (Extension Serie Taiwan Forestry Research Institute 153:98–115, 2002), Schnitzer et al. (Biotropica 38:581–591, 2006), Mulatu and Fetene (Ethiop J Biol Sci 12:1–23, 2013), and Stanley et al. (The climate action project research initiative. Paper Presented at the Second Annual Conference on Carbon Sequestration, Arlington, 2003) shall be employed for biomass and carbon stock estimation of trees, palms, lianas, bamboos, and fern trees, respectively, in Sele-Nono forest.
The removal of dyestuffs, which are an important pollutant group in textile wastewater, is an important environmental problem. Various chemical and physicochemical methods are used in the purification of these wastewaters. Recently, it is known that a wide variety of agricultural materials and their modified products have been investigated for dye removal using the adsorption process, which is a promising removal method. In this study, the removal of Basic Yellow 51 dyestuff from aqueous solutions of sugar beet pulp, first activated by saponification with NaOH solution and then modified by heating with citric acid, was investigated. For this purpose, the effects of parameters such as solution pH, sorbent dose, initial concentration, contact time and temperature on the sorption of Basic Yellow 51 dye to modified sugar beet pulp were investigated. As a result, it was found that the functional groups of pectin and cellulose substances in sugar beet pulp, which are effective in sorption, were activated and their number increased, thereby increasing the dye removal efficiency. It was found that sorption efficiency increased with increasing contact time and temperature and decreased with increasing initial concentration. It was determined that the sorption equilibrium data fit the Langmuir isotherm better and that the sorption process was endothermic and spontaneous. The q_e value was obtained from the Langmuir isotherm as approximately 200 mg/g. As a final result, it has been demonstrated that the modified product of sugar beet pulp can be used effectively in removing basic dyes from the aquatic environment.
In calcareous soil, two field experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of two potassium silicate treatments (with and without) and three irrigation levels (100, 80 and 60%, of crop evapotranspiration, abbreviated as IW100, IW80 and IW60, respectively) on wheat yield and nutrient uptake and water use efficiency (WUE). The experimental design was a strip plots design in randomized complete block arrangement with three replicates. Findings reveal that potassium silicate improved grain weight spike^−1 by about 1.06 times whether with IW80 or IW60. Also, seed index increased by 1.03, 1.06 and 1.04 times owing to potassium silicate in the 1st season under IW100, IW80 and IW60 treatments, respectively. Application of potassium silicate surpassed the control treatment by about 1.05, 1.4 and 1.07 times for biological straw and grain yields under IW80. The interaction of IW80 × potassium silicate significantly equaled IW100 × potassium silicate for P, S Mg and Mn uptake in both seasons as well as N, K and Zn uptake in the 1st season and Fe uptake in the 2nd season. IW80 or IW60 with potassium silicate application were the efficient combinations for improving WUE in both growing seasons.
The valorization of biomass has become extremely important for the polymer industry to struggle with the depletion of oil. Solvothermal liquefaction is one method where the biomass can be converted to a useful ecopolyol. However, the conventional liquefaction process causes losses of time, material, and energy. This study aims at optimizing the liquefaction process of sugar beet pulp (SBP) using a response surface methodology (RSM) based on central composite design (CCD), as well as giving detailed insights into the physicochemical properties of the obtained ecopolyols. The synthesized ecopolyols were analyzed in terms of hydroxyl number, acid number, viscosity, and water content, and their structural properties characterized using infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. It was determined that the reaction temperature and catalyst loading were more important parameters than the reaction time on the liquefaction yield (LY) according to the ANOVA results (95% confidence level). The optimum conditions of solvothermal liquefaction for SBP, confirming through validation experiments, were 4.25% catalyst loading, a reaction time of 70 min, and a reaction temperature of 170 °C, resulting in a LY of 95%. The results show that the effect of reaction temperature and catalyst loading on hydroxyl number is more dominant than the reaction time, the most determinant parameter of acid number is catalyst loading, and the most determinant parameter of viscosity is the reaction temperature. The ecopolyols produced under optimal conditions display similar characteristic features (a 29.9±1.1 mg KOH/g acid number, a 299.8±3.6 mg KOH/g hydroxyl number, a 643.8±23.7 cP viscosity at 25 °C, and a 2.1±0.5% water content) to those of petroleum-based polyols widely preferred in the industry of polyurethane foam.
Objectives This study aimed to identify whether apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) parameters are helpful in distinguishing mesorectal tumor deposits (TD) from metastatic lymph nodes (MLN) in rectal cancer (RC). Methods Thirty patients (59 lesions, including 30 TD and 29 MLN) with RC who underwent pretreatment-MRI between February 2016 and August 2018 were enrolled. The morphological features, ADC values, and semi-quantitative parameters of DCE-MRI, including relative enhancement (RE), maximum enhancement (ME), maximum relative enhancement (MRE), time to peak (TTP), wash-in rates (WIR), wash-out rates (WOR), brevity of enhancement (BRE), and area under the curve (AUC) were measured on lesions (TD or MLN) and RC. The parameters were compared between TD and MLN, tumor with and without TD group by using Fisher’s exact test, independent-samples t-test, and Mann-Whitney U test. The ratio (lesion-to-tumor) of the parameters was compared between TD and MLN. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and binary logistic regression analysis were used to assess the diagnostic ability of single and combined metrics for distinguishing TD from MLN. Results The morphological features, including size, shape, and border, were significantly different between TD and MLN. TD exhibited significantly lower RE, MRE, RE-ratio, MRE-ratio, ADC_min-ratio, and ADC_mean-ratio than MLN. RE-ratio showed the highest AUC (0.749) and accuracy (77.97%) among single parameters. The combination of DCE-MRI and DWI parameters together showed higher diagnostic efficiency (AUC = 0.825). Conclusions Morphological features, ADC values, and DCE-MRI parameters can preoperatively help distinguish TD from MLN in RC. Key Points • DWI and DCE-MRI can facilitate early detection and distinguishing mesorectal TD (tumor deposits) from MLN (metastatic lymph nodes) in rectal cancer preoperatively. • TD has some specific morphological features, including relatively larger size, lower short- to long-axis ratio, irregular shape, and ill-defined border on T2-weighted MR images in rectal cancer. • The combination of ADC values and semi-quantitative parameters of DCE-MRI (RE, MRE) can help to improve the diagnostic efficiency of TD in rectal cancer.
Background and aims The relative utility of self-expanding metal stent (SEMS) insertion for malignant colon obstruction (MCO) due to extra-colonic malignancy (ECM) versus intra-colonic malignancy (ICM) is understudied. Methods A systematic search was done from inception-April 2021 to identify reports of safety and efficacy of SEMS insertion for the treatment of MCO-ECM versus MCO-ICM. A meta-analysis of proportions, comparative meta-analysis to compute relative risks (RR), and mean differences (MD) was performed. Subgroup analyses and influence analyses were conducted. The certainty in estimates of effect(s) was assessed using the GRADE approach. Results Eight non-randomized studies were identified; 46% (39–53%) and 63% (59–67%) of patients in the ECM and ICM groups were male. Most obstructions were in the rectosigmoid colon in both ECM and ICM groups. SEMS insertion in MCO-ECM was associated with an increased risk of technical failure compared to MCO-ICM (RR 2.92; 1.13–7.54; Certainty: Very Low). Risk of clinical failure of SEMS was higher in MCO-ECM compared to MCO-ICM (RR 2.88; 1.58–2.52; Certainty: Very Low). The risk of clinical failure remained significant throughout the influence analysis, as well as on subgroup analysis. There was no significant difference in the risk of adverse events or luminal perforation with SEMS insertion among patients with MCO-ECM and MCO-ICM. On influence analysis, removal of one study unveiled a significant increase in the risk of luminal perforation in MCO-ECM (RR 3.22; 1.44–7.19; p  = 0.004). Conclusion SEMS for MCO-ECM may have a technical success rate comparable to or questionably worse than MCO-ICM, with low certainty in estimate of effects. SEMS deployment in MCO-ECM carries a higher risk of clinical failure, with a questionably higher risk of luminal perforation.
Plant-based foods should mimic the appearance of the animal-based ones they are designed to replace, such meat, seafood, egg, milk, and their products. Each food is required to have specific optical properties, such as color and opacity, which depend on the selective absorption and scattering of light. In this study, oil-in-water emulsions containing plant-derived pigments were used as model plant-based foods. The pigments were selected to represent the three primary colors: turmeric (yellow), red beet (red), and butterfly pea flower (blue). We then investigated the impact of pigment and oil droplet characteristics on the optical properties of the model emulsions, including pigment type and concentration, and droplet size and concentration. Reflectance spectroscopy and colorimetry ( L*, a*, b* values) were used to quantify the impact of these parameters on the optical properties of the emulsions. The chromaticness of the emulsions increased with increasing colorant concentration, increasing droplet size, and decreasing droplet concentration due to greater light absorption. The lightness of the emulsions increased with decreasing colorant concentration, decreasing droplet size, and increasing droplet concentration due to greater light scattering. This study provides a better understanding of the factors influencing the optical properties of plant-based foods, which could be used to optimize their appearances, thereby increasing consumer acceptance.
Maize, an important component of global food security, is threatened by various abiotic stresses. Salinity is a global problem that negatively impacts about 20% of irrigated soils and reduces crop productivity. An experiment was conducted in an open glasshouse to evaluate the response of the Single-Hybrid 10 maize cultivar in saline soil to the application of the beet sugar FC treated with a mixture of phosphoric and sulfuric acids (TFC) and molasses. Plant height and fresh and dry weight of the maize plants were significantly increased as a result of the application of 5 ton ha^−1 of TFC and 125 L ha^−1 of molasses. Besides, the application of 5 ton and 125 L ha^−1 of TFC and molasses, respectively, reduced the accumulation of Na while enhancing the accumulation of Ca and K in maize plants. The highest soil contents of K^+, Ca^2+, Mg^+, HCO_3^2−, and SO_4^− as well as the available N, P, and K, and the lowest contents of Na^+ and Cl^− as well as the lowest electric conductivity (EC) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) resulted from applying TFC and molasses at the rates of 5 ton and 125 L ha^−1, respectively. Treating beet sugar FC with a mixture of phosphoric and sulfuric acids improved the solubility of various components and reduced the economic cost of converting FC into an efficient soil amendment. TFC is a promising organic amendment of saline soils that could promote plant growth and biofortification by improving the soil physiochemical properties.
The pathogen's effectiveness may be influenced by the insect's host plants. The purpose of this study was to examine if the entomopathogenic bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki (BtK) was compatible with three hosts from diverse plant families including corn ( Zea mays L.), lettuce ( Lactuca sativa L.) and sugar beet ( Beta vulgaris L.) against Spodoptera littoralis (Boisduval). BtK showed highest toxicity toward the sugar beet population compared with other host populations. The LC_50 values of BtK were 17.67- and 7.89-fold for corn and sugar beet populations, respectively, lower than those of lettuce population. Because the difference might be explained by the dietary effects of host plants on the overall physiological condition of S. littoralis larvae, the digestive enzymatic and intermediate metabolism were investigated. The α -amylase and lipase activities in the midgut of S. littoralis lettuce population were all significantly higher than those of corn and sugar beet populations, while the highest activity of protease was observed in the corn population. In the lettuce population, the intermediary metabolism response, expressed as acid and alkaline phosphatases (ACP and ALP), was significantly ( P  ≤ 0.05) lower than those of the sugar beet and corn populations. On the contrary, the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) significantly increased on lettuce population compared with other host plants. The highest amount of protein (0.188 mg) and triglyceride (TAG: 0.219 mg/mL) was found in larvae fed on lettuce. According to these findings, the host plant has an indirect role in BtK's suppression of cotton leafworm.
Abstract Various industries around the world recognize the importance of achieving Net Zero Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emission by 2050. Industrial processes have been attributed to the increase in CO_2 concentrations causing climate change. As the rate of emissions continues to increase, there becomes a pressing need to adopt new technologies that allow for a real shift towards emission reduction. In this paper, Carbon Capture (CC) technologies are explored and reviewed across various industries namely: cement, steel, ethanol and powerplants. A statistical representation of various CC implementations and facilities is presented with a supportive case study, including some evaluative discussions of energy demands, capture rates, and economic impacts of various technology adoptions. Moreover, the paper includes a comparative data analysis of various solvents and configurations used for carbon capture, to show their effectiveness in reducing CO_2 and cost of implementation. The paper also discusses some crucial limitations and challenges of CC, including economic and technical aspects. However, with the success seen in CC applications across various industries, there remains scope for future work to address novel solvents, with reduced costs and minimum modifications to existing processes. A brief overview of life cycle assessment of carbon capture and storage is also presented. Graphical abstract 
Objectives Only few published artificial intelligence (AI) studies for COVID-19 imaging have been externally validated. Assessing the generalizability of developed models is essential, especially when considering clinical implementation. We report the development of the International Consortium for COVID-19 Imaging AI (ICOVAI) model and perform independent external validation. Methods The ICOVAI model was developed using multicenter data ( n = 1286 CT scans) to quantify disease extent and assess COVID-19 likelihood using the COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS). A ResUNet model was modified to automatically delineate lung contours and infectious lung opacities on CT scans, after which a random forest predicted the CO-RADS score. After internal testing, the model was externally validated on a multicenter dataset ( n = 400) by independent researchers. CO-RADS classification performance was calculated using linearly weighted Cohen’s kappa and segmentation performance using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). Results Regarding internal versus external testing, segmentation performance of lung contours was equally excellent (DSC = 0.97 vs. DSC = 0.97, p = 0.97). Lung opacities segmentation performance was adequate internally (DSC = 0.76), but significantly worse on external validation (DSC = 0.59, p < 0.0001). For CO-RADS classification, agreement with radiologists on the internal set was substantial (kappa = 0.78), but significantly lower on the external set (kappa = 0.62, p < 0.0001). Conclusion In this multicenter study, a model developed for CO-RADS score prediction and quantification of COVID-19 disease extent was found to have a significant reduction in performance on independent external validation versus internal testing. The limited reproducibility of the model restricted its potential for clinical use. The study demonstrates the importance of independent external validation of AI models. Key Points • The ICOVAI model for prediction of CO-RADS and quantification of disease extent on chest CT of COVID-19 patients was developed using a large sample of multicenter data. • There was substantial performance on internal testing; however, performance was significantly reduced on external validation, performed by independent researchers. The limited generalizability of the model restricts its potential for clinical use. • Results of AI models for COVID-19 imaging on internal tests may not generalize well to external data, demonstrating the importance of independent external validation.
Globally, waste disposal options such as landfill, incineration, and discharge to water, are not preferred long-term solutions due to their social, environmental, political, and economic implications. However, there is potential for increasing the sustainability of industrial processes by considering land application of industrial wastes. Applying waste to land can have beneficial outcomes including reducing waste sent to landfill and providing alternative nutrient sources for agriculture and other primary production. However, there are also potential hazards, including environmental contamination. This article reviewed the literature on industrial waste applications to soils and assessed the associated hazards and benefits. The review investigated wastes in relation to soil characteristics, dynamics between soils and waste constituents, and possible impacts on plants, animals, and humans. The current body of literature demonstrates the potential for the application of industrial waste into agricultural soils. The main challenge for applying industrial wastes to land is the presence of contaminants in some wastes and managing these to enhance positive effects and reduce negative outcomes to within acceptable limits. Examination of the literature also revealed several gaps in the research and opportunities for further investigation: specifically, a lack of long-term experiments and mass balance assessments, variable waste composition, and negative public opinion.
Despite the saline soils of Bangladesh having high potassium (K) availability, the acquisition of K by rice ( Oryza sativa L . ) is unsatisfactory. The study was designed to quantify the performance of rice yield components, macro-nutrient uptake, K^+/Na^+ ratio, and nutrient use efficiency under the influence of improved K fertilization in a salt-affected soil. The salt-tolerant Boro rice cultivar (BRRI-47) was tested with seven different K treatments (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 kg K ha^−1) with three replications followed by a complete randomized design (CRD). The results indicated that increasing K levels had a positive influence on most of the growth and yield parameters of rice except plant height, unfilled grain number, and 1000 grain weight. Application of 100 kg K ha^−1 raised the grain yield by 49% over control and 19.13% over the present national recommended dose (40 kg K ha^−1). Straw yield increased by 42% in treatment K_120 and 36% in treatment K_100 over control, respectively. The K^+/Na^+ ratio in plants was observed to be higher when K was applied at higher rates. Additionally, the different K doses improved the nutrient (N, P, K, S) uptake and decreased the internal N and K use efficiencies of rice. It can be summarized that 100 kg ha^−1 K fertilization could be effective to improve rice production and nutrient uptake in coastal saline soil of Bangladesh while maintaining a high K^+/Na^+ ratio.
Pectin with varying degree of esterification (DE) obtained from apple pomace was investigated for its functional application in encapsulating probiotics and promoting gut health. High (HM) and low methoxyl (LM) pectin emulsions at varying concentrations (HM 1.5, HM 2.5, LM 1.5, LM 2.5) were used to encapsulate Lactobacillus salivarius inside the core of a soild-oil-water (S/O/W) emulsion. The emulsions HM 1.5, HM 2.5, LM 1.5, and LM 2.5 had an encapsulation efficiency of 35.22%, 62.66%, 19.43%, and 22.50% respectively. Among all emulsions, the highest viability was promoted by HM 2.5 during storage, pasteurization and in-vitro gastro-intestinal digestion. The rheological analyses demonstrated pectin emulsions to show shear thinning behavior and dominant viscous behavior. An emulsion stability of 67.54% was seen for HM 2.5 pectin emulsions whereas it was lowest for LM 1.5. For identifying prebiotic potential, pectin was subjected to hydrolysis for 12, 24, and 48 h and thereafter employed for the growth of bacteria. HM 24 exhibited a high prebiotic score (0.74) by promoting Lactobacillus salivarius over Escherichia coli . These studies demonstrate the better encapsulating and prebiotic properties of HM pectin over LM pectin and its possible application for the same.
Salt stress is a major factor limiting plant growth and productivity, especially under the threat of climate change. Therefore, it is important to develop strategies that aim to ensure food production even under saline conditions. The exogenous application of methyl jasmonate (MJ) to mitigate stress in plants has shown promising results. In this study, we evaluated the effects of different MJ concentrations on radish ( Raphanus sativus L.) growth and morphology under salt-stress conditions. Plants were irrigated with saline (120 mM NaCl, 12.25 dS m^−1) and tap water (control, 0.31 dS m^−1) and sprayed weekly with MJ solutions (5 µM, 50 µM, 500 µM, and 5 mM) and distilled water. The experimental period started seven days after sowing (DAS) and lasted until 30 DAS. In salt-stressed plants, photosynthetic capacity was reduced and radish growth decreased by 50%; however, the chlorophyll and carotenoid concentration, electrolyte leakage, and dark respiration rate increased. Our results showed that none of the MJ concentrations mitigated growth inhibition caused by salt stress; independent of salt stress, the highest MJ concentration (5 mM) restricted the formation of fleshy storage root. In contrast, 5 µM MJ mitigated the negative effects of salt stress on carbon assimilation rate, transpiration, stomatal conductance, and dark respiration. Moreover, the growth inhibition induced by salt stress and 5 mM MJ positively correlated with the reduction in the fluorescence signal, mainly during the photochemical rise. Therefore, MJ does not mitigate salt stress in radish, and can inhibit plant growth at high concentration.
Purpose To build computed tomography enterography (CTE)-based multiregional radiomics model for distinguishing Crohn's disease (CD) from intestinal tuberculosis (ITB). Materials and methods A total of 105 patients with CD and ITB who underwent CTE were retrospectively enrolled. Volume of interest segmentation were performed on CTE and radiomic features were obtained separately from the intestinal wall of lesion, the largest lymph node (LN), and region surrounding the lesion in the ileocecal region. The most valuable radiomic features was selected by the selection operator and least absolute shrinkage. We established nomogram combining clinical factors, endoscopy results, CTE features, and radiomic score through multivariate logistic regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the prediction performance. DeLong test was applied to compare the performance of the models. Results The clinical–radiomic combined model comprised of four variables including one radiomic signature from intestinal wall, one radiomic signature from LN, involved bowel segments on CTE, and longitudinal ulcer on endoscopy. The combined model showed good diagnostic performance with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.975 (95% CI 0.953–0.998) in the training cohort and 0.958 (95% CI 0.925–0.991) in the validation cohort. The combined model showed higher AUC than that of the clinical model in cross-validation set (0.958 vs. 0.878, P  = 0.004). The DCA showed the highest benefit for the combined model. Conclusion Clinical–radiomic combined model constructed by combining CTE-based radiomics from the intestinal wall of lesion and LN, endoscopy results, and CTE features can accurately distinguish CD from ITB.

The present study was conducted to provide evidence of conditioned taste aversion learning (CTA) in the snail Cornu aspersum , using quinidine as the aversive stimulus in a procedure of Pavlovian Conditioning of Tentacle Lowering. Subjects were split into two groups: paired and unpaired. During the devaluation phase, subjects from the “paired group” received the US followed by the quinidine exposure, while subjects from the “unpaired group” received the quinidine and, 30 min later, the US. Subjects which had received the US paired with the quinidine showed a decrease of the conditioned response (CR), in contrast to subjects which had received the quinidine and the US unpaired. These results provide a useful CTA procedure in terrestrial snails. The implication of the results for learning and the physiological correlates is discussed.
Changes in Asian summer monsoon (ASM) circulation and effective precipitation (precipitation/evaporation, P/E) were reconstructed from stalagmite δ^18O and trace element records from Wulu Cave in southern China, covering Chinese Interstadial (CIS) 13 to Heinrich Stadial (HS) 5. The timing of HS 5 in our record (48.5 ± 0.1 ka, 47.2 ± 0.1 ka) agrees well with spatially-separated cave records (48.7 ± 0.1 ka, 47.4 ± 0.2 ka). At the onset of HS 5, Asian hydroclimate changes are coeval with bipolar ice-core records, but lead the Greenland warming by 300 years at the termination or are synchronous with Greenland records via the atmospheric CH_4 constraint. During HS 5, the evolution of δ^18O-based ASM, featuring four-phased variability, is less clear in element-inferred P/E variations. In contrast, the element records generally exhibit coherent variations among themselves, and are characterized by greater values in CIS 13 (stronger prior calcite precipitation (PCP) under seasonal drought conditions), followed by a rapid decline to a lower-than-average level (weaker PCP under relatively wetting conditions) during HS 5. This implicates an enhanced evaporation in the interstadial, but sufficient moisture availability during HS 5. The ASM weakening in mid-HS 5 is significantly stronger, in degree, than during Chinese Stadial (CS) 14, while the P/E variability in HS 5 is practically equivalent to that in CS 14. It suggests a pronounced sensitivity of ASM and an inertial effective precipitation response to HSs. Probably, the ocean–atmosphere interactions at low latitudes could favor the sustained moisture availability in southern China during HS 5. This at least implicates that the effective rainfall in southern China is less sensitive to climate perturbations during HS 5.
A multicomponent, family-based intervention with ≥ 26 contact hours is recommended for the treatment of childhood overweight and obesity. This intervention utilizes behavioral strategies to improve diet, physical activity, and sedentary behaviors. The evidence-based recommendations for this treatment have predominantly come from randomized trials in which the intervention is implemented by research-trained staff in academic research settings, with the intervention delivered to fairly homogeneous samples that are limited in being inclusive of those experiencing health disparities. Thus, there are challenges in implementing the recommended intervention into practice. In particular, there are implementation challenges related to providers, contact time, and settings that impact all children. Specifically, the structure of the intervention may diminish its ability to be delivered by many types of providers in different settings, limiting overall accessibility. There are implementation challenges affecting children who experience health disparities, as it is not clear how efficacious the recommended intervention is for African American or Latinx children, or children from households with low income. Several strategies to reduce identified implementation challenges, such as reducing contact time and intensity of the dietary intervention, are discussed. However, use of these strategies may reduce the effect size of the weight improvements commonly seen with the recommended intervention. Suggestions for future research regarding implementation, specifically using study designs that enhance the ability to create cost-efficient and adaptive interventions that can generalize to many different children and families, are provided.
Differentiation of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS, a precancerous lesion of the breast) from fibroadenoma (FA) using ultrasonography is significant for the early prevention of malignant breast tumors. Radiomics-based artificial intelligence (AI) can provide additional diagnostic information but usually requires extensive labeling efforts by clinicians with specialized knowledge. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of differentially diagnosing DCIS and FA using ultrasound radiomics-based AI techniques and further explore a novel approach that can reduce labeling efforts without sacrificing diagnostic performance. We included 461 DCIS and 651 FA patients, of whom 139 DCIS and 181 FA patients constituted a prospective test cohort. First, various feature engineering-based machine learning (FEML) and deep learning (DL) approaches were developed. Then, we designed a difference-based self-supervised (DSS) learning approach that only required FA samples to participate in training. The DSS approach consists of three steps: (1) pretraining a Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) model using FA images, (2) reconstructing images using the encoder and decoder of the pretrained model, and (3) distinguishing DCIS from FA based on the differences between the original and reconstructed images. The experimental results showed that the trained FEML and DL models achieved the highest AUC of 0.7935 (95% confidence interval, 0.7900–0.7969) on the prospective test cohort, indicating that the developed models are effective for assisting in differentiating DCIS from FA based on ultrasound images. Furthermore, the DSS model achieved an AUC of 0.8172 (95% confidence interval, 0.8124–0.8219), indicating that our model outperforms the conventional radiomics-based AI models and is more competitive.

Background Multimodal treatment for patients with peritoneal metastases (PM) from colorectal cancer (CRC), including perioperative chemotherapy (CT) plus complete resection, is associated with prolonged survival. The oncologic impact of therapeutic delays is unknown. Objective The aim of this study was to assess the survival impact of delaying surgery and CT. Methods Medical records from the national BIG RENAPE network database of patients with complete cytoreductive (CC0–1) surgery of synchronous PM from CRC who received at least one neoadjuvant CT cycle plus one adjuvant CT cycle were retrospectively reviewed. The optimal interval between the end of neoadjuvant CT to surgery, surgery to adjuvant CT, and total interval without systemic CT were estimated using Contal and O’Quigley’s method plus restricted cubic spline methods. Results From 2007 to 2019, 227 patients were identified. After a median follow-up of 45.7 months, the median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was 47.6 and 10.9 months, respectively. The best cut-off period was 42 days in the preoperative interval, no cut-off period was optimal in the postoperative interval, and the best cut-off period in the total interval without CT was 102 days. In multivariate analysis, age, biologic agent use, high peritoneal cancer index, primary T4 or N2 staging, and delay to surgery of more than 42 days (median OS 63 vs. 32.9 months; p  = 0.032) were significantly associated with worse OS. Preoperative delay of surgery was also significantly associated with PFS, but only in univariate analysis. Conclusion In selected patients undergoing complete resection plus perioperative CT, a period of more than 6 weeks from completion of neoadjuvant CT to cytoreductive surgery was independently associated with worse OS.
Background The lateral pelvic sidewall is a major site of local recurrence after radical resection of rectal cancer. Salvage lateral pelvic node dissection (LPND) may be the only way to eliminate recurrent lateral pelvic nodes (LPNs). This study aimed to describe the technical details of robotic and laparoscopic salvage LPND and assess the short-term clinical and oncological outcomes in patients with recurrent LPNs who underwent salvage LPND by a minimally invasive approach for curative intent. Methods Between September 2010 and 2019, 36 patients who underwent salvage surgery for LPN recurrence were retrospectively analyzed from a prospectively maintained database. Patients’ characteristics, index operation, MRI findings, and perioperative and pathological outcomes were analyzed. Results Eleven and 14 patients underwent robotic and laparoscopic salvage LPND, respectively. Eight patients (32.0%) underwent a combined salvage operation for resectable extra-pelvic sidewall metastases. There were four cases of open-conversion during the laparoscopic approach due to uncontrolled bleeding of iliac vessels. In these patients, metastatic LPNs were suspected of iliac vessel invasion and were found to be larger in size (median 15 mm; range 12–20) than that in patients who underwent successful LPND using the minimally invasive approach (median 10 mm; range 5–20). The median number of metastatic LPNs and harvested LPNs was 1 (range 0–3) and 6 (range 1–16), respectively. Six patients (24.0%) experienced postoperative complications including lymphoceles and voiding difficulties. During the follow-up (median 44.6 months; range 24.0–87.7), eight patients developed recurrences, mainly the lung and para-aortic lymph nodes, and one patient developed pelvic sidewall recurrence after laparoscopic salvage LPND. The 3-year disease-free survival and overall survival after salvage LPND were 66.4% and 79.2%, respectively. Conclusions Robotic and laparoscopic salvage LPND for recurrent LPNs are safe and feasible with favorable short-term surgical outcomes. However, the surgical approach should be carefully chosen in patients with large-sized and invasive recurrent LPNs.
Objectives To determine the extracellular volume (ECV) fraction derived from equilibrium contrast-enhanced CT for predicting pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Methods The ECV fraction before NCRT (ECV_pre) and/or ECV after NCRT (ECV_post) of rectal tumors was assessed, and ECV_Δ was calculated as ECV_post − ECV_pre. The histopathologic tumor regression grading (TRG) was assessed. pCR (TRG 0 grade) was defined as the absence of viable tumor cells in the primary tumor and lymph nodes. Demographic and clinicopathological characteristics and ECV fraction were compared between the pCR and non-pCR groups. A mixed model was constructed by logistic regression. The performance for predicting pCR was assessed with the area under the receiver-operator curve (AUC). The AUCs of the different methods were compared by the method proposed by DeLong et al. Results Seventy-five patients were included; 17 achieved pCR, and 58 achieved non-pCR. The ECV_post (17.05 ± 2.36% vs. 29.94 ± 1.20%; p < 0.001) and ECV_Δ (− 17.01 ± 3.01% vs. 0.44 ± 1.45%; p < 0.001) values in the pCR group were significantly lower than those in the non-pCR group. The mixed model that combined ECV_post with ECV_Δ achieved an AUC of 0.92 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.81–0.98), which was higher than that of ECV_post (AUC, 0.91 (95% CI = 0.80–0.97); p = 0.60) or ECV_Δ (AUC, 0.90 (95% CI = 0.79–0.97); p = 0.61). Conclusions ECV_post and ECV_Δ determined by using equilibrium contrast-enhanced CT were useful in distinguishing between pCR and non-pCR patients with LARC who received NCRT. Key Points • ECV _ post and ECV _ Δ (ECV _ post − ECV _ pre ) differed significantly between the non-pCR and pCR groups. • ECV _ pre cannot be used to predict the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. • ECV _ post combined with ECV _ Δ had the best performance with an AUC of 0.92 for predicting pCR after NCRT in LARC.
It is of great significance for regional ecological protection and sustainable development to quickly and effectively assess and monitor regional ecological quality and identify the factors that affect ecological quality. This paper constructs the Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to analyze the spatial and temporal evolution of ecological quality in the Dongjiangyuan region from 2000 to 2020. An ecological quality trend analysis was conducted through the Theil-Sen median and Mann-Kendall tests, and the influencing factors were analyzed by using a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model. The results show that (1) the RSEI distribution can be divided into the spatiotemporal characteristics of “three highs and two lows,” and the proportion of good and excellent RSEIs reached 70.78% in 2020. (2) The area with improved ecological quality covered 17.26% of the study area, while the area of degradation spanned 6.81%. The area with improved ecological quality was larger than that with degraded ecological quality because of the implementation of ecological restoration measures. (3) The global Moran’s I index gradually decreased from 0.638 in 2000 to 0.478 in 2020, showing that the spatial aggregation of the RSEI became fragmented in the central and northern regions. (4) Both slope and distance from roads had positive effects on the RSEI, while population density and night-time light had negative effects on the RSEI. Precipitation and temperature had negative effects in most areas, especially in the southeastern study area. The long-term spatiotemporal assessment of ecological quality can not only help the construction and sustainable development of the region but also have reference significance for regional ecological management in China.
Background and objectives The Reporting and Data System (RADS) have been used in the attempts to standardize the results of oncological scans in different scenarios, such as lymph nodes, adding configuration criteria to size determination. We analyze the predictive value of preoperative Node-RADS determination at imaging for pelvic lymph node (PLN) involvement in cases of prostate cancer (PC) considered for radical prostatectomy (RP) with extended lymph node dissection (eLND) and we compare it with validate predictive nomograms (MSKCC, Briganti and Gandaglia). Methods 150 patients with a histological diagnosis of PC (high risk or intermediate with an estimated risk for pN+ higher than 5% using the Briganti or 7% using the Gandaglia nomogram) submitted for RP with an ePLND from 2018 and 2021 were retrospectively examined. Node-RADS determination was performed in all cases using the preoperative magnetic resonance (MR), performed by a radiologist blinded for pathologic results and compared with the MSKCC, Briganti 2012, Gandaglia 2017 and Gandaglia 2019 nomograms. Results PLN involvement at final pathology (pN+) was found in 36/150 (24.0%) of cases and the mean percentage of positive LNs in pN+ cases was 15.90 ± 13.40. The mean number of PLNs removed at RP was similar ( p  = 0.188) between pN0 (23.9 ± 8.0) and pN+ (25.3 ± 8.0) cases. Considering a Node RADS 4–5 positive and a Node RADS 1–2 negative, the PPV was 100% and the NPV was 79.6%. A Node RADS score 4–5 showed a lower sensitivity (0.167 versus 0.972, 1.000, 0.971, 0.960 respectively), a higher specificity (1.000 versus 0.079, 0.096, 0.138, 0.186 respectively) and a similar AUC (0.583 versus 0.591, 0.581, 0.574, 0.597 respectively) when compared to MSKCC, Briganti 2012, Gandaglia 2017 and Gandaglia 2019 nomograms. Conclusions Our evaluation suggests that Node RADS score, combining configuration criteria to size determination could improve specificity in terms of pathologic PLN prediction but a very low sensitivity has been also described.
Purpose To develop a prediction model incorporating clinicopathological information, US, and MRI to diagnose axillary lymph node (LN) metastasis with acceptable false negative rate (FNR) in patients with early stage, clinically node-negative breast cancers. Methods In this single center retrospective study, the inclusion criteria comprised women with clinical T1 or T2 and N0 breast cancers who underwent preoperative US and MRI between January 2017 and July 2018. Patients were temporally divided into the development and validation cohorts. Clinicopathological information, US, and MRI findings were collected. Two prediction models (US model and combined US and MRI model) were created using logistic regression analysis from the development cohort. FNRs of the two models were compared using the McNemar test. Results A total of 964 women comprised the development (603 women, 54 ± 11 years) and validation (361 women, 53 ± 10 years) cohorts with 107 (18%) and 77 (21%) axillary LN metastases in each cohort, respectively. The US model consisted of tumor size and morphology of LN on US. The combined US and MRI model consisted of asymmetry of LN number, long diameter of LN, tumor type, and multiplicity of breast cancers on MRI, in addition to tumor size and morphology of LN on US. The combined model showed significantly lower FNR than the US model in both development (5% vs. 32%, P  < .001) and validation (9% vs. 35%, P  < .001) cohorts. Conclusion Our prediction model combining US and MRI characteristics of index cancer and LN lowered FNR compared to using US alone, and could potentially lead to avoid unnecessary SLNB in early stage, clinically node-negative breast cancers.
In order to explore the strengthening effect of contact ultrasound on cold air drying(CAD) of yam, contact ultrasound strengthened cold air drying (CUCAD) experiments were carried out. The effects of ultrasonic power and cold air temperature on drying characteristics, microstructure and effective moisture diffusivity were studied, and the drying process was simulated by BP, RBF, Elman and RNN neural network models. The results showed that increasing ultrasonic power and drying temperature could significantly shorten the drying time of yam, facilitate the formation and expansion of micropores, and improve the internal mass and heat transfer of material. With the decrease of water content, the drying rate gradually decreased. The prediction performance results of the four neural network models were compared, and the RNN network model could achieve the highest fitting accuracy for the prediction of CUCAD process of yam. Therefore, contact ultrasound could achieve a significant strengthening effect during CUCAD process.
Plant growth and development depends on water availability and a scarcity or excess can reduce the production of root crops such as radishes. Thus, adequate irrigation levels for radish plants are essential to avoid water stress, and strategies should be developed to overcome negative stress effects and improve tuberous root production. Here, we aimed to determine the effects of exogenous ascorbic acid (AA) and irrigation levels on radish growth, biomass allocation, and photosynthetic responses. Radish plants were irrigated with a water holding capacity (WHC) of 100% (W100, control), 70% (W70), and 50% (W50) and foliar sprayed with 0 and 2 mM AA. Growth parameters (root diameter, length and volume; and leaf number and area), biomass accumulation (shoot and root fresh weight; shoot, root and total dry weight), biomass allocation (shoot/root ratio and organ mass fractions) and gas exchange (carbon assimilation rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration, intercellular CO_2 concentration and instantaneous carboxylation efficiency) were evaluated. The growth of radish plants was impaired when irrigated with W100, probably due to water-logging in the soil, which reduced shoot and root growth and the carbon assimilation rate ( A ) compared with W50 and W70. Ascorbic acid affected biomass allocation parameters and instantaneous carboxylation efficiency ( A/C _ i ), but not growth and biomass accumulation. W70 was the optimal condition for radish growth and biomass accumulation, regardless of exogenous AA.
The global meat substitute industry is estimated to be worth $8.1 billion by 2026. Prevailing health consciousness among consumers and their concern for the future environment has lifted the concept of meat alternatives from niche to the mainstream. Numerous research findings have emphasized the importance of meat alternatives or substitutes formulated from plant protein, animal cells, and insect-based sources, which emulate the nutritional composition and sensorial properties of animal meat. The current review discusses the necessity of meat substitutes, and their evolution, and bestows an outline of the ongoing research in this field. Novel protein sources such as vegetal proteins (cereal, pulses, oil seeds) and non-vegetal proteins (fungal, air protein, insect, myofibril) are reported to offer a viable alternative to animal meat. However, the functionalities of these proteins and the structuring technique influence the textural properties of the end products. Thus, the selection of a suitable technique is an important aspect in the formulation of the meat alternative. A thorough discussion of various structuring techniques for synthesizing matrixes and fibers with similar textural attributes to that of animal meat has been presented. Furthermore, limitations that confine consumers’ acceptance, the feasibility of scale-up, and the prerequisite for the regulatory framework for meat alternatives have also been pointed out. Overall, the ingredients and techniques of formulation of meat alternatives discussed in detail in this review can provide insight to the researchers and industries in formulating novel meat alternatives.
Soil salinity is one of the most challenging issue for sustainable crop productivity worldwide, and kenaf is an important natural fiber crop with considerable salt tolerance. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms in kenaf salt tolerance. In this study, 60 kenaf cultivars were screened for salt tolerance, and after analysis of agronomic and physiological indexes, cultivar CP018 and CP047 were found to have the highest and the lowest salt tolerance, respectively. This was mainly demonstrated in the lower root MDA content of 26.78% in CP018 compared to 29.76% in CP047, while the enzyme activities of SOD, POD, and CAT were mostly higher in CP018 than in CP047. Then using these two cultivars CP018 and CP047 as representing salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive cultivars, further global gene expression analysis responses to salt stress were conducted under control (0-mM NaCl) and salt stress (200-mM NaCl) conditions. The result indicated 11,677 (6538 up- and 5139 down-regulated) and 11,764 (6159 up- and 5605 down-regulated) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in CP018 and CP047, respectively. Transcription factors including WRKY , LBD , HSF , and NAC , most of which were up-regulated in CP018 compared with CP047. KEGG enrichment analysis identified significantly different gene expression related to metabolic pathways, such as ROS scavenging, sucrose and starch metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction, cysteine and methionine metabolism, phenylpropane, and flavonoid biosynthesis in both cultivars, and these pathways may be partly responsible for the differences in salt tolerance between CP018 and CP047. These findings may help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of salt tolerance in kenaf.
Crop production requires specific management strategies and practices in semiarid areas. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of mycorrhizal inoculation on hemp ( Cannabis sativa L.) grain production and the relationship between water and light inputs in yield improvement. This study was conducted in Shahrekord, Iran, in 2014–2015 using a randomized complete block design with split-plot restriction. Treatments included irrigation regimes with four levels (severe stress, moderate, mild, and well-watered) and mycorrhizal inoculation. Mycorrhizal colonization and grain P content decreased by increasing drought stress, but electrolyte leakage and root/shoot ratio raised. The grain yield was minimum under severe stress despite the effect of mycorrhizae under moderate and especially mild stress levels due to the reduced symbiosis between mycorrhizae and hemp root. According to the results, mycorrhizal inoculation increased water use efficiency (WUE), radiation use efficiency (RUE), and relative water content (RWC), resulting in a yield increase compared to non-inoculated plants. Generally, the positive role of mycorrhizae, especially under mild water stress conditions, improved the efficiency of light consumption and water efficiency, followed by more water supply for hemp production in semiarid environments.
Molasses, a sugar industry waste product with low cost and high sugar content, can be used as a high-quality carbon source for microbial fermentation. In this study, molasses was pretreated by means of acid–base treatment combined with 0.6% mass fraction of activated carbon in order for its sugar concentration (78.42 g/L) and composition to meet the needs of Clostridium tyrobutyricum fermentation. C. tyrobutyricum was able to produce butyric acid from the sugars of treated molasses by microbial adaptive laboratory evolution. After 120 h of shake flask fermentation, high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography showed that 46.39% of fructose and 32.56% of glucose in molasses after treatment were converted to 31.52 g/L butyric acid by C. tyrobutyricum . The results showed that the two-step process, combined with microbial adaptive laboratory evolution technology used to hydrolyze and reuse sugar, is an adapted method for the utilization of molasses, a by-product of the sugarcane industry.
The cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (CGMMV) and tobacco vein banding mosaic virus (TVBMV) ( Tobamovirus and Potyvirus genera, respectively) are responsible for significant economic damage to cucurbitaceous and tobacco crops worldwide. In this research, we show that the Nicotiana benthamiana protease inhibitor (NbPI) interacts with the coat proteins (CP) of these two viruses. When the NbPI gene was silenced by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), inoculation of CGMMV or TVBMV into plants resulted in more severe symptoms and a higher viral RNA replication level compared to plants without gene silencing. These results indicate the antiviral role of host factor NbPI against CGMMV and TVBMV in N. benthamiana .
In arid and semi-arid climates, soil salinization and calcareousness are increasingly serious problems, threatening agricultural sustainability. Using bio-organic amendments to improve rhizosphere hydro-physico-chemical properties of saline calcareous soils is necessary to hasten restoration processes. This study aimed to explore the impact of bio-organic amendments on rhizosphere hydro-physico-chemical properties and nutrient status of saline calcareous soil along with oxidative stress biomarkers, antioxidant capacity, morpho-physiological attributes, nutritive value, and forage yield of multi-stressed Atriplex nummularia . A two-field experiment (2020 and 2021), comprising of five treatments replicated thrice, was conducted in a completely randomized block design. The treatments were un-amended control, leguminous compost (LCt), LCt supplemented with humic acid (HA), LCt inoculated with Spirulina platensis (SP), and LCt supplemented with HA + SP. Each bio-organic amendments, with a rate of 20 t ha^−1, were applied to amend saline calcareous soil characterized by the electrical conductivity of saturated soil past extract (ECe = 8.5 dS m^−1), 32.5% CaCO_3, and poor organic matter for growing A. nummularia . Applying bio-organic amendments, particularly Spirulina platensis -inoculated humified leguminous compost, ameliorated soil defects through the improvement of hydro-physico-chemical properties by lowering soil reaction (pH), ECe, CaCO_3 content, and exchangeable Na^+ and Ca^2+, increasing cation exchange capacity, organic matter, and water retention at field capacity, thus maintaining higher nutritional status. These findings were positively reflected in morpho-physiological attributes, forage yield, and nutritive value (increased soluble protein and nutrients). B-group vitamins (e.g., thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pyridoxine, folic acid, and cyanocobalamin) of multi-stressed A. nummularia forage were also improved. Furthermore, this treatment significantly boosted non-enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidants, detoxifying reactive oxygen species (i.e., superoxide and hydrogen peroxide), nitrite and nitrate contents, and reducing malondialdehyde and electrolyte leakage, associating with greater stress tolerance in A. nummularia . Overall, application of Spirulina platensis -inoculated humified leguminous compost is a promising sustainable approach in amending rhizospheric soil properties, nutrient availability, and exchangeability of Na^+ and Ca^2+, thus maximizing forage yield and quality of A. nummularia in a saline calcareous arid region.
The phytoremediation is a significant natural clean-up process for removal of heavy metals from wetland saline soils (WS) for the sustainable environmental pollution control. Therefore, the phytoremediation potential of Typha domingensis (southern cattail) and Phragmites australis (common reed) has been evaluated for absorption and accumulation of salts and heavy metals growing at two sites of WS samples coded as BS_1 and BS_2 (“BS” the soil that is not adjoining to root of plants) in Hyderabad Sindh, Pakistan. The three parts (root, stems, and leaves) of both Plants were obtained from several of locations oxidized the matrices of each part of plants and the corresponding soil samples using acid mixture. A variety of techniques were used to identify the metals by atomic absorption spectrometry. The average values of heavy metals, Co, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn in BS_1 and BS_2 were found to be (8.53, 14.4, 8.88, 64.3, 13.3, and 142) and (12.4, 18.2, 13.6, 89.4, 14.4, and 124) µg/g, respectively. The data of bioconcentration (BCF) and translocation factors (T_F) of the research showed that the studied halophytes showed a high accumulation potential (> 1) for heavy metals from WS. The metal content in plants and rhizospheric soil have a strong relationship ( p  < 0.01). The screening data based on classical methods and GC–MS indicated that the studied phyto extractants have many phytochemicals. These phytochemicals may have the capability to accumulate heavy metals from contaminated soils. The roots and their rhizospheric soil (RS_1 and RS_2) have a highly significant relationship of accumulation potential with the selected heavy metals (RS is soil adjoining to roots of plants) ( p  < 0.01). These halophytes are able to remove heavy metals directly from salty metal-contaminated soil in wetland environments.
Climate change issues are calling for advanced methods to produce materials and fuels in a carbon–neutral and circular way. For instance, biomass pyrolysis has been intensely investigated during the last years. Here we review the pyrolysis of algal and lignocellulosic biomass with focus on pyrolysis products and mechanisms, oil upgrading, combining pyrolysis and anaerobic digestion, economy, and life cycle assessment. Products include oil, gas, and biochar. Upgrading techniques comprise hot vapor filtration, solvent addition, emulsification, esterification and transesterification, hydrotreatment, steam reforming, and the use of supercritical fluids. We examined the economic viability in terms of profitability, internal rate of return, return on investment, carbon removal service, product pricing, and net present value. We also reviewed 20 recent studies of life cycle assessment. We found that the pyrolysis method highly influenced product yield, ranging from 9.07 to 40.59% for oil, from 10.1 to 41.25% for biochar, and from 11.93 to 28.16% for syngas. Feedstock type, pyrolytic temperature, heating rate, and reaction retention time were the main factors controlling the distribution of pyrolysis products. Pyrolysis mechanisms include bond breaking, cracking, polymerization and re-polymerization, and fragmentation. Biochar from residual forestry could sequester 2.74 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per ton biochar when applied to the soil and has thus the potential to remove 0.2–2.75 gigatons of atmospheric carbon dioxide annually. The generation of biochar and bio-oil from the pyrolysis process is estimated to be economically feasible.
Natural ceramide, a biologically active compound present in plants, has been used widely in food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries. Abundant ceramide has been detected in sewage sludge, which has inspired the idea to recycle ceramide from it. Therefore, the methods of extracting, purifying, and detecting ceramides from plants were reviewed, with the aim to establish methods to get condensed ceramide from sludge. Ceramide extraction methods include traditional methods (maceration, reflux, and Soxhlet extraction) and green technologies (ultrasound-assisted, microwave-assisted, and supercritical fluid extraction). In the past two decades, more than 70% of the articles have used traditional methods. However, green extraction methods are gradually improved and showed high extraction efficiency with lower solvent consumed. The preferred technique for ceramide purification is chromatography. Common solvent systems include chloroform–methanol, n-hexane–ethyl acetate, petroleum ether-ethyl acetate, and petroleum ether-acetone. For structural determination of ceramide, infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry are used in combination. Among quantitative analysis methods for ceramide, liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry was the most accurate. This review concludes that with our prilemenary experiment results it is feasible to apply the plant “extraction + purification” process of ceramide to sludge, but more optimization need to be performed to get better results.
Soil amendments, such as pyrochar (PC) and hydrochar (HC), have the potential to enhance soil properties and crop yields. The objective was to investigate the effects of HC from anaerobic digestion effluent (ADE) of sewage sludge (SS), ADE of manure (M), and PC, as soil amendments. Lettuce seeds were sown and grown in soil amended with chars at rates of 1 to 15 g char/kg soil. Soil properties and plant responses were compared to soil without amendment (control). Soil amended with HC-ADE-SS and HC-ADE-M had higher pH, phosphorus content, and cation exchange capacity than the control. All treatments and the control resulted in 80% + emergence rates. Root dry mass of plants grown on soil with 10 and 15 g/kg was higher than the control. No negative effects were observed in emergence and whole-plant dry biomass, indicating that HC-ADE-SS and HC-ADE-M could be amended without negative impacts on soil properties and plant responses.
Low phosphorus (P) availability is a major problem for cotton production. However, little is known about cotton agronomic and physiological traits associated with low P tolerance. Therefore, the agronomic and physiological performance of three cotton genotypes with strong tolerance to low P (STGs) and three cotton genotypes with weak tolerance (WTGs) was characterized under low and normal P conditions in hydroponic and pot culture. The results showed that low P significantly reduced dry matter production, photosynthesis, and carbon metabolism in both STGs and WTGs; however, the reduction was more in WTGs. In contrast, low P improved root morphology, carbohydrate accumulation, and P metabolism, especially in STGs genotype Jimian169, whereas the opposite responses were observed for WTGs mainly DES926. The multivariate analysis suggested that root morphological traits, carbohydrate contents, and enzymes related to P metabolism were strong positively correlated and contributed more to the genotypic variation, suggesting the importance of root over shoot in low P tolerance. Moreover, plants grown under low P produced low yields than normal P, whereas WTGs yields were lower than the STGs yield. Overall, it was suggested that the low P tolerance of cotton genotypes is closely related to root morphology and physiology. In the future, the identified contrasting low P tolerant cotton genotypes Jimian169 and DES926 will be used to understand the molecular mechanisms of low P tolerance in cotton.
The present investigation was undertaken to study the effect of individual (sequential) and tank mix (simultaneous) applications of nutrients, i.e . zinc (Zn), iron (Fe) and nitrogen (N) on different symbiotic parameters, productivity and economics of chickpea. A 2-year field study was conducted in randomized complete block design, which comprised twelve treatments in spraying combinations of three nutrients (Zn, Fe and N) at flowering and pod formation stages of chickpea. The nutrients were applied as 0.5% zinc sulphate (ZnSO_4), 0.5% ferrous sulphate (FeSO_4) and 2% urea either as sole, combination of any two or all the three nutrients as sequential as well as tank mix foliar sprays. The sequential application of ZnSO_4 (0.5%), FeSO_4 (0.5%) and urea (2%) recorded the highest number of nodules, dry weight of nodules, leghaemoglobin content, chlorophyll content and grain yield (1906 and 1947 kg ha^−1 in the first and second year, respectively) closely followed by tank mix application of the same nutrients (1894 and 1925 kg ha^−1). However, tank mix application of all the three nutrients recorded higher net returns (715.52 and 850.08 US$ ha^−1) and benefit–cost ratio (1.42 and 1.67) over sequential application (701.02 and 841.10 US$ ha^−1 and 1.33 and 1.58) of the three nutrients. Furthermore, application of the three nutrients either as sequential or tank mix provided higher productivity as well as economic returns over single or combined application of any of the two nutrients. Tank mix application of ZnSO_4 (0.5%), FeSO_4 (0.5%) and urea (2%) at flowering and pod formation stages is a new technique for increasing the productivity and economic returns of chickpea, which requires a special attention for improving the socio-economic status of chickpea growers.
Prevalent narratives of agricultural innovation predict that we are once again on the cusp of a global agricultural revolution. According to these narratives, this so-called fourth agricultural revolution, or agriculture 4.0, is set to transform current agricultural practices around the world at a quick pace, making use of new sophisticated precision technologies. Often used as a rhetorical device, this narrative has a material effect on the trajectories of an inherently political and normative agricultural transition; with funding, other policy instruments, and research attention focusing on the design and development of new precision technologies. A growing critical social science literature interrogates the promises of revolution. Engagement with new technology is likely to be uneven, with benefits potentially favouring the already powerful and the costs falling hardest on the least powerful. If grand narratives of change remain unchallenged, we risk pursuing innovation trajectories that are exclusionary, failing to achieve responsible innovation. This study utilises a range of methodologies to explore everyday encounters between farmers and technology, with the aim of inspiring further work to compile the microhistories that can help to challenge robust grand narratives of change. We explore how farmers are engaging with technology in practice and show how these interactions problematise a simple, linear notion of innovation adoption and use. In doing so, we reflect upon the contribution that the study of everyday encounters can make in setting more inclusionary, responsible pathways towards sustainable agriculture.
Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus are among the few aspergilli that produce aflatoxins and cause aflatoxin-related toxicity. To protect against these dangers, it is crucial to produce plant-based solutions that not only protect the balance of the ecosystem but also the health of living beings using natural methods. In this study, the effects of different doses of A. aestivus , B. vulgaris , and M. alba leaf extracts on the development and reproduction of A. flavus and A. parasiticus fungi were investigated and an experimental study was conducted. The inhibition rates of A. aestivus , B. vulgaris , and M. alba extracts were calculated by applying them to petri dishes containing A. flavus and A. parasiticus fungi at concentrations of 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 mg/ml. As a result of the research, the inhibition rates of A. aestivus , B. vulgaris , and M. alba extracts were found to be between 3.13–89.94%, 2.63–76.3%, and 2.29–73.9%, respectively. In terms of the lethal dose, the plant with the highest amount of development-inhibiting active ingredient per unit was A. aestivus with a concentration of 22 mg/ml and an inhibition rate of 50.8%. B. vulgaris and M. alba also showed similar effects with inhibition rates of 50.33% and 50.14% at concentrations of 26 mg/ml, respectively. An artificial intelligence model has been developed to estimate the antifungal effect on doses that have not been measured. In the development of the model, training was performed using the decision tree regressor (DT), extra trees regressor (ET), random forest regressor (RF), gradient boosting regressor (GBR), light gradient boosting machine (LIGHTGBM), K-nearest neighbors regressor (K-NN), AdaBoost regressor (ADA), ridge regression (RIDGE), least angle regression (LAR), and Bayesian ridge (BR) algorithms. The successful algorithm was evaluated according to the performance criteria of mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination R^2, and the K-NN model with an R ^2 value of 0.96 was found to be the most successful. The K-NN model was used to estimate the inhibition percentage values of the unmeasured leaf extract doses with the least error in the 1–30 mg/ml dose range. With this expert model, the development of organic fungicides with varying dose and leaf types can be performed much faster.
Huge quantities of vegetables and fruits by-products are discarded annually worldwide following the industrial food processing techniques. These biowastes were found to cause further environmental hazards. However, they could represent rich sources of numerous bioactive metabolites and substrates for high valued products. Specifically, onion ( Allium cepa L.) and potato ( Solanum tuberosum L.) are of economic importance since they are cultivated and found as chief components of most food recipes worldwide. Nevertheless, potato peels and the outer onion scaly leaves are major non-edible by-products. Both biowastes are rich in bioactive phenolic compounds, whereas potato peels are rich in chlorogenic acids and onion solid wastes in flavonoids, particularly flavonols (quercetin derivatives). Also, they are good sources of dietary fibers, fatty acids, starches, sugars and proteins. In addition, they are potential candidates for biofuels production. Hence, with the recent advances of bio-refinery concepts valorization of such treasures is highly recommended. The current review highlighted the major metabolic classes of onion and potato agro-industrial wastes and how we can utilize the available possibilities to maximize the recovery and benefits of metabolites found in these wastes.
The growing global population and higher living standards instantly demand the transition in the direction of a sustainable food system. A substantial section of means and agricultural lands are presently committed to protein-rich feed production to rear livestock for human consumption. Conversely, accelerated farming activities and the food industry have rendered a drastic increase in waste which impair the economic and environmental sustainability of the ecosystem. This situation emerges the need for developing an integrated technology for waste management and to improve sustainability footprints. Microbial protein (MP) production based on renewable electron and carbon sources has the potential as a substitute protein source. MP production for animal feed use is growing fast and is derived from bacteria, algae, and fungi including yeast. MP produced from all types of microbes is currently commercialized and in use. However, novel methods and processes are also under investigation to make MP production more economical and sustainable. Current research on MP has concentrated on the valorization of waste materials by using high protein content-containing microorganisms, which can then be used in animal feed. Using such kind of integrated approach, the agroindustry waste resources upcycling can contribute towards finding sustainable, cheaper, and environment-friendly protein sources. This review first describes the potential waste feedstock for MP production and summarizes the recent progress in the application of MP-producing microorganisms including fungus, yeast, bacteria, and phototrophic microbes. Bioprocesses, and production technology advances for MP production have been explored and discussed in detail. Finally, the MP application as animal feed, its challenges, and future perspectives in research have been evaluated.
Key Message Inga marginata can tolerate high Cu concentrations. In contrast, A. edulis was sensitive to Cu. High Cu levels changed root morphology and photosynthetic variables in both species. Abstract The excess of heavy metals such as copper (Cu) in degraded areas worldwide has increased pollution and toxicity in plants. Thus, it is necessary to use phytoremediation species in reforestation programs to reestablish the ecological conditions of the environment. The aim of the study was to evaluate the tolerance/sensitivity of Inga marginata and Allophylus edulis to excess Cu by evaluating morphological, physiological and biochemical variables to define species to be cultivated in environments contaminated with Cu. Seedlings of I. marginata and A. edulis were cultivated at five Cu concentrations: 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 μM. Each sampling unit consisted of a pot with five plants. Shoot and root morphological variables, photosynthetic variables, chlorophyll a fluorescence, photosynthetic pigments, antioxidant enzyme activity, hydrogen peroxide concentration, lipid peroxidation, Cu concentration and accumulation in tissues were assessed. We found that A. edulis is sensitive to excess Cu and that it can be used as an indicator of contaminated areas. Seedlings of I. marginata tolerated high Cu concentrations, which mainly accumulated in the roots, and did not show a decrease in root and shoot dry weight. Therefore, I. marginata has great potential to be used in the phytoremediation of Cu-contaminated soils.
Employing aerobic fermentation, Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the genus Xanthomonas produce the high molecular weight natural heteropolysaccharide known as xanthan. It has various amounts of O-acetyl and pyruvyl residues together with D-glucosyl, D-mannosyl, and D-glucuronyl acid residues in a molar ratio of 2:2:1. The unique structure of xanthan allowed its various applications in a wide range of industries such as the food industry, pharmacology, cosmetics and enhanced oil recovery primarily in petroleum. The cultivation medium used in the manufacture of this biopolymer is critical. Many attempts have been undertaken to generate xanthan gum from agro-based and food industry wastes since producing xanthan gum from synthetic media is expensive. Optimal composition and processing parameters must also be considered to achieve an economically viable manufacturing process. There have been several attempts to adjust the nutrient content and feeding method, temperature, pH, agitation and the use of antifoam in xanthan fermentations. Various modifications in technological approaches have been applied to enhance its physicochemical properties which showed significant improvement in the area studied. This review describes the biosynthesis production of xanthan with an emphasis on the importance of the upstream processes involving medium, processing parameters, and other factors that significantly contributed to the final application of this precious polysaccharide.

Fast exhaustion of fossil fuel stocks, as well as problems allied with air pollution, has created a worldwide attention in searching for alternative, renewable lignocellulosic macromolecule–based sources of energy. Bioethanol is one of the valuable substitutes produced by fermentation process. It significantly reduces the consumption of fossil-based fuels and thereby the net carbon dioxide emission. The looming requirement for replacing the fuels based on fossils with a more eco-friendly renewable solution has created much attention in finding out abundant and cheap resources for biofuel production. The utilization of easily available, cheaper, and renewable lignocellulosics would make bioethanol more competitive than fossil fuels. Novel substrates, strain improvements, limited byproducts, product tolerance, and fermentation conditions have been drawing researchers’ attention to increase bioethanol productivity. The present paper discusses the bioethanol production from lignocellulosic-based renewable resources. It also focuses on present challenges and prospects for efficient bioethanol production.
Chilo sacchariphagus Bojer is a serious sugarcane stalk borer in China. Screening of artificial diet formulations can provide the foundation for mass rearing indoor and biological research of C. sacchariphagus . Four different artificial diet formulations (I, II, III, IV) were set to feed for C. sacchariphagus . The experiment was carried out in a constant temperature incubator with temperature 26 ± 1 °C, humidity 75 ± 5 °C and photoperiod 14L:10D. The growth and development indexes were observed to determine the best feed formula for C. sacchariphagus . The results showed that the hatching rate, larval survival rate, pupation rate and fecundity of C. sacchariphagus fed with diet III (sugarcane stalk powder 40 g, sweet corn grain 240 g, yeast powder 20 g, agar 16 g, casein 10 g, sucrose 10 g, cholesterol 0.24 g, choline chloride 0.4 g, sorbic acid 1 g, methylparaben 1 g, multidimensional element sheet 1 g, 40% formaldehyde 0.5 ml and distilled water 800 ml) were higher than those of the other three formulas. From the life table parameters, the net reproductive rate ( R _0), the intrinsic rate of increase ( r _ m ) and the finite rate of increase ( λ ) of Formula III were higher than those of the other three formulas. In summary, artificial diet III is more suitable for the growth and development of C. sacchariphagus and can be used as a formula for indoor diet.
The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of citric acid combined with high-pressure processing (HPP) on the characteristics of pectic polysaccharide of Choerospondias axillaris fruit peel (CPP). Therefore, the physicochemical, structural, and emulsifying properties of CPP extracted by hydrochloric acid (HEP), HPP-assisted hydrochloric acid (HEP + HPP), citric acid (CEP), and HPP-assisted citric acid (CEP + HPP) were analyzed. Results showed that citric acid and HPP had a synergetic impact on extraction yield, weight-average molecular weight (Mw), emulsion ability (EA), and apparent viscosity of CPP; hence, the highest extraction yield (48.49%) and EA (70.25%) coupled with the lowest Mw (263.80 kDa) and apparent viscosity were observed in CEP + HPP. However, the effects of citric acid and HPP on DA, DM, and GalA of CPP were opposite. The lowest DA and DM were found in HEP + HPP. Moreover, both citric acid and HPP had great influences on the structure of CPP. The CPP extracted by citric acid had a lower crystallinity, and the microstructure of CPP extracted with HPP assistance was rougher. In summary, HPP-assisted citric acid extraction could improve the extraction yield and emulsion property of CPP.
Background While the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is growing worldwide, dietary intake plays a remarkable role in the management of disease complications. Evidence suggests that beetroot has health-promoting potentials, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antidiabetic properties. Therefore, the present clinical trial aimed to investigate the effects of concentrated beetroot juice (BJ) supplementation on anthropometric measures, glycemic control, blood pressure (BP), and lipid profile in T2D patients. Methods In the simply randomized, parallel-group, controlled, and open-label trial, forty-six patients with T2D were randomly allocated to either the intervention group (BJ group), who consumed 24 ml concentrated BJ daily for 12 weeks, or the control group without any intervention. Anthropometric measurements, physical activity, dietary intakes, glycemic measures, lipid profile, and blood pressure were assessed at the baseline and the end of the study. Results Plasma nitric oxide (NO) in the intervention group had a higher nonsignificant increase after 12 weeks compared with the control group (8.57 ± 23.93 vs. 2.31 ± 15.98, P  = 0.128). Compared with the baseline, significant reductions in plasma insulin (14.55 ± 7.85 vs. 10.62 ± 6.96, P  = 0.014) and homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-B) (3.96 ± 0.83 vs. 3.63 ± 0.75, P  = 0.038), as well as a marginally significant reduction in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (70.81 ± 11.24 vs. 65.44 ± 6.46, P  = 0.058) were observed in the control group after 12 weeks. Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was significantly reduced in the BJ group compared with the baseline (74.73 ± 16.78 vs. 72.36 ± 16.09, P  = 0.046). After adjusting for baseline values, no significant effect on the levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin, hemoglobin A1c (HgA1c), HOMA-β, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), HDL, triglycerides (TG), and blood pressure (BP) was observed. Conclusions Our study showed that daily consumption of 24 ml concentrated BJ did not affect the levels of glycemic measures, blood pressure, and lipid profile. More studies are necessary to confirm these findings. Trial Registration This present clinical trial has been registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials with registration number IRCT20150815023617N5.
Drought stress is a severe threat to crop plants that negatively impacts morphological, physiological, and biochemical changes in maize. Vermicompost (VC), a living soil organic amendment is safe and effective fertilizer used in agricultural practices to prevent the damage caused by chemical fertilizers. Also, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) used as nitric oxide (NO) donor in plants displays a role in various plant developmental processes as well as plant responses to drought stress. In the present study, six maize ( Zea mays L.) cultivars, Composite C5, Composite C6, Composite C8, Composite C14, Composite C15, and Super Composite 1 collected from different regions of Thanamandi, Loran, Budhal, Nakar, Mahore, and Seri were exposed to drought (15% Poly ethylene glycol) stress, and photosynthetic attributes, growth, antioxidants, and oxidative stress were studied. Maize crop grown in Budhal cv. Composite C8 emerged as the drought-tolerant cultivar that showed maximum photosynthesis, growth, antioxidants with least oxidative stress. Both NO (100 µM as SNP) and VC played a prominent role in the protection of photosynthetic functions and combatting drought stress in the Composite C8 cultivar of maize. Application of NO with VC maximally ameliorated drought stress and promoted photosynthesis by the increased nitrogen assimilation, and the activity of antioxidant enzymes. The application of NO along with VC may be adopted as a practice to reduce ill effects of inorganic fertilizers and promote photosynthesis of drought grown maize.
Excessive methylglyoxal (MG), which is produced by plants in response to biotic or abiotic stress, could be removed by the glyoxalase system. Glyoxalase I is the main component of the glyoxalase system, and it plays an important role in conferring abiotic stress tolerance of plants. In this study, glyoxalase I activity of different daylily ( Hemerocallis spp.) varieties was measured and compared, showing that glyoxalase I activity was positively correlated with salt tolerance in daylily. In addition, a putative glyoxalase I gene ( HfGlX I-1 ) of daylily was cloned and introduced to tobacco ( Nicotiana benthamiana ). Results showed that the glyoxalase I activity of transgenic plants was higher than that of wild-type plants, indicating that HfGlX I-1 served as glyoxalase I. Furthermore, transgenic tobacco showed tolerance to abiotic stress, including drought, high concentrations of sodium chloride and zinc chloride. Our results could establish the potential selection system of salt-tolerant daylily and provide a molecular tool to modify the biotic tolerance of ornamental plants.
Purpose Alfalfa ( Medicago sativa L.) production is adversely impacted by surface runoff and drought stress. This is particularly true for alfalfa planted in semiarid areas. Therefore, the development of erosion-tolerant management practice is crucial. Methods A study was carried out in a completely randomized design, with 4 treatments (3 straw biochar application rates + flat planting (FP) as control), and 3 straw biochar application rates of 0 × 10^4 (no biochar (NB)), 3 × 10^4 (single straw biochar-soil crust (SSB)) and 6 × 10^4 kg hm^−2 (double straw biochar -soil crust (DSB)), respectively. Results Mean runoff efficiency in SSB was 16.58% compared to no-biochar treatment (20.14%), and in DSB was 14.57%. From 2017 to 2020, NB had the highest R^2 value for the variation between runoff and rainfall and DSB had the lowest R^2 value. In comparison to FP treatment, application of biochar to SSB significantly ( p  < 0.05) reduced runoff and increased soil water storage. The difference in soil water storage between pre-sowing and post-harvesting during alfalfa growth season increased on average by 15.69% with NB practice compared to FP, and by 11.79% and 7.58% with SSB and DSB practices, respectively. The mean weight diameter (MWD) in SSB treatment was higher than that in DSB treatment, although soil nutrients were increased in the following order: DSB > SSB > NB > FP. After post-harvest, average yields in NB, SSB, and DSB treatments were higher than those in FP treatment by 8.16%, 25.71%, and 18.31% respectively. With a mean yield of 8607 kg ha^−1, SSB significantly increased alfalfa yield across all years. Conclusion Evidence from the four-year experiment suggested that biochar-soil crust made from a single straw significantly reduced surface runoff, increasing soil water storage, soil aggregate stability, soil nutrients, and alfalfa fodder yield. Based on our research, we advise using single straw biochar-soil crust to boost alfalfa fodder production in semi-arid regions.
Yeasts play different roles in the environment and might be involved in plant development processes. However, only a few yeast species and strains have been investigated in relation to plant-growth promotion. In this study, Papiliotrema terrestris , a soil basidiomycetous yeast, was tested for its effects on maize ( Zea mays L.) plants. The plant-growth promotion depended on the concentration of the yeasts. Overall, the application of P. terrestris strain CCY 17-29-1 to the maize grains in the concentrations of 10^4 and 10^5 cells ml^−1 increased the growth of roots, shoots, the formation of lateral and adventitious roots and the concentration of photosynthetic pigments. The application of P. terrestris in the concentration of 10^5 cells ml^−1 showed a positive effect on the germination rate. The application of yeasts in the concentrations of 10^4 and 10^5 cells ml^−1 increased the concentrations of some macro-nutrients (P, K, Mg, Ca) and micro-nutrients (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn) in the plant roots and shoots. We have verified that P. terrestris is able to produce IAA and change the endogenous concentrations of IAA in plants. The PCA showed that the application of P. terrestris to the maize grains in the concentrations of 10^4 and 10^5 cells ml^−1 had the most impact on root characteristics.
Key message TFL1 -like genes of the basal eudicot Platanus acerifolia have conserved roles in maintaining vegetative growth and inhibiting flowering, but may act through distinct regulatory mechanism. Three TERMINAL FLOWER 1 ( TFL1 )-like genes were isolated and characterized from London plane tree ( Platanus acerifolia ). All genes have conserved genomic organization and characteristic of the phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP) family. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis indicated that two genes belong to the TFL1 clade, designated as PlacTFL1a and PlacTFL1b , while another one was grouped in the BFT clade, named as PlacBFT . qRT-PCR analysis showed that all three genes primarily expressed in vegetative phase, but the expression of PlacTFL1a was much higher and wider than that of PlacTFL1b , with the latter only detected at relatively low expression levels in apical and lateral buds in April. PlacBFT was mainly expressed in young stems of adult trees followed by juvenile tissues. Ectopic expression of any TFL1 -like gene in Arabidopsis showed phenotypes of delayed or repressed flowering. Furthermore, overexpression of PlacTFL1a gene in petunia also resulted in extremely delayed flowering. In non-flowering 35:PlacTFL1a transgenic petunia plants, the FT -like gene ( PhFT ) gene was significantly upregulated and AP1 homologues PFG , FBP26 and FBP29 were significantly down-regulated in leaves. Yeast two-hybrid analysis indicated that only weak interactions were detected between PlacTFL1a and PlacFDL, and PlacTFL1a showed no interaction with PhFDL1/2. These results indicated that the TFL1 -like genes of Platanus have conserved roles in repressing flowering, but probably via a distinct regulatory mechanism.
Drought stress is the most detrimental factor among the abiotic stresses that globally affected the legumes crop productivity and cause of economic loss and threatened food security. The pot experiment was designed to study the role of ascorbic acid (AsA), benzyl amino purine (BAP) and moringa leaf extract (MLE) for induction of drought stress tolerance on two pea cultivars (Mateo rans Pea-09). Both pea cultivars were subjected to drought stress (60% field capacity) after 20 days of germination while controlled plants were maintained at 100% field capacity. Treatments of BAP (0.005%), AsA (0.005%) and MLE (30%) were applied as foliar spray after two weeks of imposed water stress. When plants undergo water stress regimes, growth, chlorophyll and yield attributes decreased significantly as compared to control. While antioxidant enzymes peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), osmolytes such as proline and glycine betaine (GB) increased to respond water stress. Foliar application of BAP, AsA and MLE under water-scarce situations up-regulated the enzymatic antioxidants and enhanced growth and yield attributes under water stress. The total soluble proteins and nitrate reductase (NR) decreased while total free amino acids, proline and soluble sugars increased under water deficit situations. Foliar application of these substances also decreased the over expressed malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H_2O_2) contents under water deficit regimes. The foliar spray of these growth regulators increased growth and yield by increasing photosynthetic pigments, up-regulating the enzymatic antioxidants and osmolytes under water stressed and non-stressed conditions.

Socio-economic and environmental factors have led scientific community to find alternative approaches for management of agro-industrial wastes. An integrated approach, i.e., clean biotechnology, could be used for the conversion of agro-industrial wastes into industrial important and less toxic end products. Bacterial cellulose (BC) is an incredibly multifaceted biomaterial with desirable attributes including biodegradability, biocompatibility, great tensile strength, cellulose purity, and porosity. An economical BC production is difficult to owing to the cost of expensive synthetic media. By utilizing processed agro-industrial wastes as media substrate, a sustainable large-scale BC production can be achieved along with an effective waste management strategy. Various types of industrial wastes including crop residues, food industry by-products, distillery effluents, and kitchen wastes are used to produce BC. This review is centered on various aspects of cost-effective BC production using industrial wastes and a wide range of probable substrates with alternative methods for enhanced BC production. Novel applications involving BC in the field of environment, wound healing, drug delivery, dental treatment, etc., with an emphasis on new economic opportunities are also discussed. Overall, this study suggests that integrating different methods and techno-economic analysis would be advantageous to researchers in finding way for sustainable production of BC with reduced environmental pollution for diverse applications.
The aim of this study was to analyze the energy and profitability of dried apricot production in terms of sustainability. The study was carried out in the Malatya province of Turkey. The samples of the study were 65 apricot farmers that were determined by the proportional sampling technique. The data collected belonged to the production period of 2019–2020. In the study, socio-economic characteristics of farmers were put forward, energy input-output analysis and economic analysis of dried apricot production were performed. According to the results for dried apricot production, total energy input, energy output, energy output/input ratio, energy productivity, specific energy, energy intensiveness, and net energy were determined to be 14,928.12 MJ, 28,794.44 MJ, 1.93, 0.14 kg MJ^−1, 6.90 MJ kg^−1, 7.65 MJ $^−1 and 13,866.32 MJ, respectively. Net profit obtained for apricots was calculated to be 2604.41 $ ha^−1. The most important criterion for the growing decision of apricot farmers was apricot yield.
Introduction P. florida is one of the edible fungi in the genus Pleurotus that have been shown to produce toxins with nematotoxicity. Realizing the importance of managing one of the most important plant-parasitic nematodes, Meloidogyne incognita in an ecofriendly way, P. florida has been studied in detail. Methods The methods included obtaining and preparing the nematode inoculum. P. florida was isolated on Potato dextrose agar media and culture filtrate (cfP) was prepared from it to study the interaction between second-stage juveniles and cultural filtrate of Pleurotus florida (cfP) in vitro. Interaction between second-stage juveniles and P. florida was also studied in culture medium. Urtica dioica green manure was prepared under greenhouse conditions. In vitro test was done to assess the compatibility of Urtica dioica with P. florida before evaluating the combined effect of Spent Mushroom Substrate (SMS) of P. florida and U. dioica green manure (GM) on the population of M. incognita under glasshouse condition. Results The immobilization of second-stage juveniles (J2) by the fungus P. florida was found inversely proportional to the time period of incubation. Whereas, the trapping of J2 by the fungus P. florida and the time period of incubation was found directly proportional. It was found that the paralysis of J2 decreased with the increase in dilutions of cultural filtrate. The overall increase in growth parameters of tomato and decrease in reproduction parameters of M. incognita was found in the treatment where 60g GM and 100g SMS was used per 2 kg of nematode infested soil. Conclusion The findings revealed that P. florida is nematophagous and its spent mushroom substrate could be useful for M. incognita biocontrol. M. incognita population in the soil can be reduced drastically when used with other soil amendments and hence U. dioica , a common weed can be used as a green manure crop which improves the efficacy of P. florida.
Abstract Metal contamination is a worldwide issue that is particularly present and ubiquitous in urban environments. Many pollinators, including species of bees, butterflies, and moths are found in heavily modified landscapes where they may be negatively affected by exposure to metal contamination. Increased efforts to convert vacant urban lands to habitat that benefits such communities necessitates a thorough understanding of the hazard and risks pollinators face in metal contaminated landscapes. This investigation revealed that bees and butterflies have complex species and population specific responses to metals. Exposure to these pollutants can have reproductive, immunological, behavioral, and developmental impacts. These include challenged reproductive efforts, longer developmental times, and elevated brood mortality for pollinators. Implications for insect conservation This review shows that pollinator conservation efforts are threatened if we fail to recognize the importance of metal exposure within contaminated landscapes. Bees and butterflies are exposed to metal concentrations in legacy cities that can cause reproductive, development, or behavioral impacts.
Abstract α-L-Arabinofuranosidases (Abfs) play a crucial role in the degradation of hemicelluloses, especially arabinoxylans (AX). Most of the available characterized Abfs are from bacteria, while fungi, as natural decomposers, contain Abfs with little attention given. An arabinofuranosidase ( Th Abf1), belonging to the glycoside hydrolase 51 (GH51) family, from the genome of the white-rot fungus Trametes hirsuta , was recombinantly expressed, characterized, and functionally determined. The general biochemical properties showed that the optimal conditions for Th Abf1 were pH 6.0 and 50°C. In substrate kinetics assays, Th Abf1 preferred small fragment arabinoxylo-oligosaccharides (AXOS) and could surprisingly hydrolyze di-substituted 2^3,3^3-di-L-arabinofuranosyl-xylotriose (A^2,3XX). It also synergized with commercial xylanase (XYL) and increased the saccharification efficiency of arabinoxylan. The crystal structure of Th Abf1 indicated the presence of an adjacent cavity next to the catalytic pocket which led to the ability of Th Abf1 to degrade di-substituted AXOS. The narrow binding pocket prevents Th Abf1 from binding larger substrates. These findings have strengthened our understanding of the catalytic mechanism of GH51 family Abfs and provided a theoretical foundation for the development of more efficient and versatile Abfs to accelerate the degradation and biotransformation of hemicellulose in biomass. Key points • ThAbf1 from Trametes hirsuta degraded di-substituted arabinoxylo-oligosaccharide. • ThAbf1 performed detailed biochemical characterization and kinetics. • ThAbf1 structure has been obtained to illustrate the substrate specificity.

The future of the food system is often framed as a choice between a ‘conventional’ and an ‘alternative’ system of agriculture. This framing reflects a decades-long debate between opposing worldviews around agricultural paradigms, and it has constrained conversations regarding the creation of a sustainable global food system. Globally, agricultural production is diverse, and outcomes are achieved via a combination of several production systems. However, emerging technologies over the past 10 years are now being applied across agricultural systems resulting in enabling novel approaches to production. This paper explores the challenges and opportunities of integrating emerging technologies and food production approaches (e.g., digital agriculture, genomic innovations, cellular agriculture, hydroponic farming) and coupling these with industrial and urban design principles (e.g., industrial ecology, mixed-use densification). We characterize a high-yield, local (HYL) agriculture approach, which involves shorter supply chains, decentralized control of the food system, and potentially reduced land use as well as a lower environmental footprint. The paper concludes with a discussion on how the HYL approach will vary depending on the geographical and place-based contexts in which it is implemented. It identifies key policy opportunities and considerations for ensuring HYL agriculture can support transitions to sustainable food systems, including climate change mitigation, habitat and biodiversity conservation, safety and nutrition standards, public communications, and labour and economy., resulting in a novel element to be incorporated into the ‘portfolio’ of agricultural strategies.
The search for energy security and environmental sustainability has fueled a growing interest in biofuel production worldwide. Although first-generation bioethanol is regarded a clean, renewable, and green alternative to fossil fuels, its production process leads to the generation of a huge amount of waste with high polluting potential. This review article presents a thorough analysis of the production chain of sugarcane-based first-generation bioethanol and the chemical characterization of the wastes produced in this process. The sugarcane wastes analyzed in this work include three lignocellulosic materials, namely, sugarcane straw, bagasse, and filter press mud; bagasse ash, a material rich in silica particles and other oxides; and vinasse, a material containing high concentrations of organic matter and diverse nutrients. Considering the negative impacts of the disposal and/or containment of wastes generated during the production of sugarcane bioethanol, the review will shed light on the current value-added uses of these wastes and their potential for the development of highly innovative products. The current value-added uses of these wastes include tapping the energy present in straw and bagasse, by burning them in furnaces of bioethanol refineries, and the application of bagasse ash, filter press mud, and vinasse in agriculture as fertilizers and soil additives. With regard to the innovative application of bioethanol wastes, bagasse can be used for the production of second-generation ethanol, while bagasse ash can be employed as supplementary input for the production of construction materials.
This study uses isotopic analyses to explore how new railroad transportation systems influenced Chinese diaspora meat sourcing and animal husbandry in the nineteenth-century American West. Isotopic compositions of animal bone collagen ( n =224) demonstrate tremendous dietary diversity for pigs and chickens, across both C_3-to-C_4 and omnivory continuums, reflecting variable reliance on local (C_3) plants versus use of imported maize (C_4) feed and maize-fed and/or finished animals from the Midwest. We argue that these results highlight both the cultural importance of Chinese chicken husbandry and the widespread impact that the Transcontinental Railroad had on food supply across the American West.
Functional beverages originate primarily from fruits and vegetables sources, but also include those from other plants such as tea, coffee, cocoa, soybean as well as animal products like milk and dairy-based and alcoholic drinks. They have definite medical or health benefits which include prevention or delaying the progress of diseases. Indian gooseberry is a very rich source of vitamin C and phenolics, two potent antioxidant compounds. Similarly curcumin in turmeric, piperine in black pepper and gingerol in ginger have proven antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Incidence of covid-19 pandemic has raised awareness among people the importance of maintaining higher levels of immunity. A study was undertaken at Kerala Agricultural University during 2020–21 to develop an herbal functional drink from Indian gooseberry fruit juice incorporated with turmeric and black pepper powders, ginger juice extract and juice of acid lime fruits. The herbal drink formulated with these ingredients was homogenized at an operating pressure of 175 Bar with a speed of 235 SPM and was subsequently pasteurized at 100 ^0 C for 10 minutes in glass bottles, followed by storage under refrigerated conditions at 5 ± 2 ^0 C for 3 months. The initial ascorbic acid, total phenolics, total flavonoids, total carotenoids and total curcumin contents were 61.0 mg100g^− 1, 184.0 mg100g^− 1, 153.0 mg100g^− 1, 119.98 mg100g^− 1 and 31.0 mg100g^− 1, respectively. Antioxidant activity of the herbal drink was determined by three assays, viz. ABTS, DDPH and FRAP. The initial IC _50 values of the herbal drink by ABTS, DPPH and FRAP assays were 8.64, 0.212 and 0.368 μgml^− 1, respectively. Significant decline in ascorbic acid, total flavonoids, total carotenoids and curcumin content were recorded in the product during storage in contrast to the total phenolics content which showed a significant rise over the storage period. Antioxidant activity of the herbal drink determined by all the three assays also declined significantly throughout the storage period. The results indicate that the product can be promoted as a healthy drink which has to be stored at low temperature in order to retain higher levels of antioxidant compounds and antioxidant activity. Graphical Abstract 
Plastics are flexible and can be molded and pressed into solid things in a range of shapes and sizes, allowing them to be widely used in several fields of life. A rising accretion of plastic wastes has become a serious societal and environmental problem. Various forms of plastics may disrupt soil or land and the aquatic continuum in a variety of ways. Microbial and enzymatic biodegradation has been reported recently, which opens the door to developing biological treatment methods for plastic trash. Various aspects that interrupt the enzymatic and microbiological processes motivate the scientist to search for new sustainable procedures that have fewer or no detrimental effects. Therefore, finding new ways to get rid of plastic wastes is crucial. In this review, we have briefly described the microbes and enzymes capable of degrading a wide range of commonly used synthetic plastics, including polypropylene, polyethylene, polyurethane, and polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, and polyethylene terephthalate. Furthermore, we have emphasized plastic products depolymerization through nanotechnology and genetic engineering, as well as current efforts to use such products as fuel sources, light-weight steel, and aluminum manufacture of high-value compounds. Taken together, these results will lead to the development of a concept for bio-upcycling plastic wastes by establishing a link between plastic waste biodegradation and the production of valuable compounds by microorganisms. Finally, but certainly not least, the solutions that can be readily implemented by humans are also considered.
Plants are most affected by the abiotic (temperature, drought, salinity etc.) and biotic stresses (bacteria, fungus, virus, nematode etc.) which have been increased by the disturbances posed by human intervention, climate change, improper use of pesticides and environmental cues. Plants are sessile in nature and they require unprecedented advances to protect themselves from the harsh environment like other living organisms. There are several studies indicating that the plants have evolved themselves over time to utilise beneficial elements to enhance their development, photosynthetic capacity, antioxidant enzyme activity and finally they can stimulate mechanisms of resistance to abiotic and biotic stress factors. Essential elements, certain elements known as beneficial elements support the growth and development of plants as well as improving responses to stressors and environmental stimuli. When plants are exposed to environmental cues such as saline soils, heavy metal toxicity, drought, low temperatures, pathogens or pest insects, beneficial elements may induce defence response, tolerance and resistance that allows plants to survive against such stressors. Hence, beneficial elements may have promising potential to cope with climate change and plant productivity under restrictive conditions. This review discusses about the mechanism, uptake and current research demonstrating the importance and significance of beneficial elements such as Silicon, Selenium, Titanium, Iodine and Cadmium metals.
Purpose of Review Intestinal adaptation is the main treatment goal in short bowel syndrome to control symptoms and improve health-related quality of life. This can be achieved in part through the use of medical therapies as well as parenteral and enteral nutrition, including oral dietary choices. This review will focus on dietary and medical management of short bowel syndrome and offer insights into novel nutritional and pharmacological approaches that may benefit patients. Recent Findings A balanced oral diet inclusive of whole plant-based foods may be beneficial in short bowel syndrome for reasons including alleviating symptoms, preventing disease-related complications, and optimizing the intestinal microbiome. Adjunctive medical therapies are often needed to improve symptoms, treat comorbid conditions, and reduce reliance on parenteral nutrition. Summary Though treatment must be tailored to individual anatomy and symptoms, newer dietary and pharmacologic approaches may be promising for short bowel patients. Future prospective studies are needed to further understand their efficacy.
Currently, statistical experimental design is employed as a quality control method to produce excellent products at the lowest possible cost in food processing, speeding up the process of developing new foods, cutting down costs associated with research, easing the process of moving food products from the research and development stage to the manufacturing stage, and troubleshooting manufacturing issues. In the extraction of bioactive compounds from food, the optimization procedure becomes more straightforward as the optimum conditions of the numerous evaluated responses converge to a similar section. However, the problem becomes more complicated when the optimum values for each response go further apart, making it harder to discover settings that satisfy all of them simultaneously. Using a mathematical function, multiple responses can be integrated into a single one in another manner. The generated response surface enables the calculation of optimum values for extraction parameter, which fulfills all responses whenever possible. Hence, this article reviewed multiple responses, desirability function, and graphical optimization solutions employed to extract food bioactive compounds in the last decade. These techniques’ benefits, drawbacks, potentials, and applications were discussed, including some of their uses in the extraction of bioactive compounds. This will help to address the actual mathematical and statistical issues that arise during the multiple response extraction of food bioactive compounds. Graphical Abstract 
Hypoxia can reduce cellular respiration, ATP synthesis and crop yield and increase production of reactive oxygen species. The use of biostimulants in agriculture has been growing considerably and its use is associated as a strategy to increase crop productivity and plant resistance against abiotic stress. This study aimed to verify the influence of the application of biostimulants on the development and yield of soybean crop grown under hypoxia under field conditions. The treatments were composed of different biostimulants, being the control (no application), Lysine, Tryptophan, Methionine, Betaine-glycine, Histidine, Arginine, Leucine, Aparagine, Alanine, Glutamic acid, Proline, Phenylamine, Serine, Valine, Amino acid extract and algae extract, applied via foliar in soybean cultivated under hypoxia totaling 17 treatments. Hypoxia significantly reduced chlorophyll concentration, number of branches, shoot fresh weight and yield of soybean plants. The use of serine, proline, valine, algae and, amino acid extracts, methionine, arginine and betaine-glycine is promising to increase soybean tolerance to hypoxia by improving physiological parameters, development and yield of plants. Our results contribute to increase knowledge about the influence of biostimulants in combating the stress caused by hypoxia in the soybean crop and can be used as a strategy in agriculture to increase food production in the face of climate change and population growth in order to guarantee food security.
Silicon (Si) is one of the essential and important elements that plays a vital role in the growth and productivity of crop plants by improving their nutritional status. The exogenous application of Si activates plant defense and phytohormones signaling mechanisms under biotic and abiotic stresses. Different soil factors such as soil pH, texture, organic matter, and temperature significantly influence the bioavailability and solubility of Si in the soil system. However, the uptake, transport, and accumulation of Si within the plants depend upon Si-transporters including LSi1, LSi2 , and LSi6 that are present in the roots of plants. From the past few decades, the role of Si in mineral nutrient deficiencies, toxicities, biotic and abiotic stresses is being explored in cereals crops. Si improves the plant resistance against pathogenic stress, salinity, drought, heat, and heavy metals by regulating the defense system. In addition, Si facilitates the uptake of essential nutrients and restricts metal ions by making conjugates, provides mechanical strength to plant cell wall, and enhances the resistance against unwanted environmental conditions. It potentially regulates phytohormones biosynthesis, improves photosynthetic attributes, and increases the activities of antioxidant enzymes to reduce the harmful impacts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other toxic ions. Furthermore, the actual mechanisms behind Si-mediated alterations in plants under mineral nutrient stress are still unclear; however, a little literature is available on other abiotic stresses. Therefore, this study summarizes the findings from various investigations for better understanding the mechanism, regulation, and crosstalk among different phytohormones, micro- and macro-nutrient disorders, other biotic and abiotic stresses and their possible solutions in response to exogenous applications of Si (soil or foliar). Overall, this study suggested that Si supplementation significantly enhances the physio-biochemical attributes, defensive mechanism, hormonal regulation, and activates the regulation of expression pattern of stress responsive genes under stressful conditions.
Stem borers (Lepidoptera) are common cereal pests. In many parts of the world, the species Ostrinia nubilalis and Sesamia nonagrioides stand out as important insect pests of economically important crops such as maize. Their management relied mainly on transgenic host plant resistance over the last 25 years. Technologies based on the insecticidal properties of Bacillus thuringiensis -derived proteins allowed widespread pest population suppression, especially for O. nubilalis . However, the recent discovery of Bt resistance, which has revitalized interest in both pests’ biology and management, may jeopardize the effectiveness of such transgenic technologies. Historical information on O. nubilalis bionomy may need to be reassessed in light of changing climate conditions and changing agricultural practices, as well as increased production of alternate host crops across its distribution range. The current paper examines the bioecology and historical research that has been conducted to manage these two important maize-boring pests.
Sludge from the wastewater treatment plant of the Argentinean Navy icebreaker ship “Almirante Irizar” was used as inoculum for biohydrogen production. The bacterial community was monitored throughout the fermentation, by sequencing 16S rRNA amplicons, to establish the microbial dynamics of the bioreactor over time. The established operating procedure assured a hydrogen content, along the process, in the range of 59.2–70.0%. The predominant species found were Clostridium sensu stricto and Sporolactobacillus sp. Clostridium showed higher values in the beginning of the fermentation with more than 90% of relative abundance. Conversely, Sporolactobacillus reached values close to 20% at its end. Additional topics discussed are the role of lactic acid bacteria in fermentative biohydrogen production systems and a series of in-process parameters that would allow control of this population. The results obtained allow supporting the use of this type of sludge as a source of hydrogen-producing bacteria.
In this study, a cake formulation has been proposed in which trehalose was applied as a partial sugar replacer at different ratios (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%) of trehalose to total sugars. The physiochemical, textural, sensory, microbial, and physical properties of the cake samples were investigated. The results indicated that both the moisture content and water activity of trehalose-containing samples were lower than those of the control (0% trehalose). During a 28-day storage period, the peroxide values of trehalose-containing samples were determined, which might be attributed to the antioxidant activity of trehalose. However, trehalose-containing samples exhibited less volume expansion in the baking process. Performing a color analysis revealed that higher trehalose ratios applied to the cake led to an increase in the lightness (L*) and yellowness (b*) values of the cake crumb and crust while it reduced the redness (a*) factor. The sensory analysis scores increased when a moderate amount of trehalose was used. The Scanning Electron Microscopy images indicated that the cake texture was firmer and less porous when the ratio of trehalose to total sugar increased. Additionally, the trehalose-treated samples were determined healthy in terms of microbiological properties during the storage time. Comprehensively, it can be claimed that trehalose is a suitable replacer for sugar in cake production especially when applied partially.
Ethylene promotes seed germination under stress, but the optimum concentration and effect on cotton seeds under salt stress are unclear. In this paper, Nongdamian 601 seeds were used to identify the optimal ethephon (ethylene donor) concentration that promotes cotton seed germination, using 2–150-mM NaCl stress as the study range. The study also examined the effect and physiological characteristics at the optimal ethephon concentration to alleviate cotton seed germination under salt stress. At 150-mM NaCl stress, 2-mM ethephon treatment significantly increased the germination rate and germination potential of cotton seeds by 73.30 and 66.00%. At 7 days of germination, ethephon treatment reduced root length, surface area, and volume more than salt stress, but ethephon increased root diameter. Moreover, ethephon treatment significantly increased the contents of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, proline, and soluble sugar of seeds than salt stress. Ethephon significantly increased the content of malondialdehyde. These results indicate that ethylene enhances the salt tolerance and germination rate of cotton seeds by enhancing the activity of antioxidant enzymes, increasing proline content, and alleviating the degree of membrane lipid peroxidation.
Important in the cultivation of corn for biogas production is the selection of appropriate hybrids, macro- and micronutrient dozing and the evaluation of energy and economic efficiency of their use. Therefore, this article presents the results of 3-year field research (2019–2021) on the yield of maize hybrids of different maturity groups grown for silage. The influence of the application of macronutrients and micronutrients on fresh and dry mass yield, chemical composition, methane yield, energy, and economic efficiency was analysed. It was established that depending on the maize hybrid, the application of macro- and micro-fertilizers increased the yield of the fresh mass of maize by 1.4–24.0% compared to options without their use. The evaluation of the theoretical yield of CH_4 based on the content of fats, protein, cellulose, and hemicellulose is also presented in different samples of maize. The findings show that the application of macro-and micro-fertilizers is suitable from the energy and economic points of view — profitability begins to appear at the price of biomethane of 0.3–0.4 euros per 1 m^3.
Palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) have been considered as a potential candidate in the field of biomedical applications due to its unique properties such as huge catalytic, hydrogen storage, and sensing behavior. Therefore, Pd NPs have shown to have a significant potential for the development of antimicrobials, wound healing, antioxidant, and anticancer property in recent days. There are plenty of reports that showed superior properties of noble metals. However, only very few studies have been undertaken to explore the advantage of Pd NPs in the field of biomedical applications. This review reports detailed and comprehensive studies comprising of the synthesis, characterization, and potential applications of Pd NPs in biomedicine. This report provides evidences in the literature documented by early researchers to understand the potential applications of Pd NPs to be explored in various fields.
Globally, concerted efforts are being made to enhance crop productivity, to meet the rising food demands. Improving the photosynthetic process is one of the thrust areas to enhance crop productivity. The present study using tobacco transgenics expressing MaUSP1 -like, a gene cloned from Indian mulberry, demonstrates that crop biomass can be improved by minimizing the photosynthetic limitations. The transgenic plants exhibited significantly higher plant height, total leaf area and root growth, which improved the total biomass by 28%. The photosynthetic parameters estimated ( V _cmax, J , TPU , and R _d) were significantly higher in the transgenic plants indicating an improvement in overall photosynthetic kinetics, partially overcoming the limitations associated with product utilization. The study demonstrated that minimizing the photosynthetic limitations contributes to enhanced photosynthetic efficiency. Hence, approaches/attempts to minimize photosynthetic limitations would be beneficial for increasing crop productivity in the future, especially in the era of changing climate.
Worldwide pollution of waters and soils is a rising health issue calling for advanced decontamination methods such as adsorption of contaminants on biochar because biochar is carbon-negative material displaying many adsorptive properties. Biochar has been improved by chemical, physical and magnetic modifications, and by surface decoration, yet the recent development of biochar-supported composites appears more promising. Here we review biochar-supported composites with focus on preparation, mechanisms, biochar-clays, biochar-microorganisms, biochar-enzymes, and applications to adsorb metals, nutrients and organic contaminants.
Sitotroga cerealella (Oliv.) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) is one of the most important post-harvest pests of maize Zea mays L. Some Mexican maize races ( Z. mays ) could be a novel source of resistance against S. cerealella to improve commercial maize varieties, lines and hybrids. We studied the resistance of Mexican maize races, recollected at Chihuahua State to S. cerealella . We focused on antibiosis and tolerance of maize to S. cerealella . Cristalino-079 maize race shows low level of consumption in grams and percentage, increased larvae mortality before to entering the seed. In addition, Cristalino-079 reduced first adult’s generation and show the largest biological cycle. Due to the small number of emerged adults, there was very little grain weight loss in resistant maize race. The compound that causes high mortality of larvae before to entering the grain is in the pericarp of resistant maize races. The compound that causes longest development time is in the endosperm and embryo. Cristalino-079 show the better level of resistance to S. cerealella infestation in almost all traits studied and this can be used as source of resistance for maize breeding.
The intention of this present study is to optimize the recovery of pectin from Persea americana peel (PAP) examining four independent process variables (pH, solvent to substrate ratio (SSR) (ml/g), agitation time (AGT) (h), and agitation speed (AGS) (rpm)) and compare the pectin recovery (PR) using statistical (Box-Behnken response surface design (BBRESD)) and non-statistical (artificial neural network (ANN) with genetic algorithm (GA)) methods. Optimal condition derived in ANN-GA (pH of 1.9, SSR of 16 ml/g, AGT of 2.1 h, AGS of 99 rpm, and PR of 90.59%) has forecast PR very precisely than BBRESD (pH of 2, SSR of 14 ml/g, AGT of 2 h, AGS of 100 rpm, and PR of 85.44%). Extrapolative capacities of two methods were examined by several statistical restraints. Structural analysis (FT-IR and XRD) of PR was exhibited that highly esterified and amorphous nature of pectin was recovered from PAP. Recovered pectin was melted at the temperature of 258.5 °C which was similar to commercial pectin. SEM observations revealed that recovered pectin was flake and spherical particle. The results of this work suggested that pectin from PAP is one of the good sources to recover pectin with good quality as commercial pectin and used as a food ingredient.
Global use of pesticides brings uncertain risks to human and nontarget species via environmental matrix. Currently, various models for exposure risk assessment are developed and widely used to forecast the impact of pesticides on environmental organisms. In this study, five commonly used insecticides, seven herbicides and three fungicides were chosen to analyze the subsequent risks in groundwater in simulated scenarios using China-PEARL (Pesticide Emission Assessment at Regional and Local Scales) model. In addition, their exposure risks to soil organisms were characterized based on risk quotient (RQ) approach. The results indicated that 23.3% of the total 528 predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) of pesticides and respective metabolites in groundwater from six Chinese simulated locations with ten crops were above 10 μg L^−1. Furthermore, acceptable human risks of pesticides in groundwater were observed for all simulation scenarios (RQ < 1). Based on the derived PECs in soil short-term and long-term exposure simulation scenarios, all compounds were evaluated to be with acceptable risks to soil organisms, except that imidacloprid was estimated to be with unacceptable chronic risk (RQ = 27.5) to earthworms. Overall, the present findings provide an opportunity for a more-comprehensive understanding of exposure toxicity risks of pesticides leaching into groundwater and soil. Graphical abstract 
Abstract JUNCAO, as energy grass, was used in mesophilic anaerobic digestion (MAD) to produce methane, which has a huge market potential in biomass energy. This study was conducted to evaluate the characteristics of MAD of Arundo donax cv. Lvzhou No.1 (Lvzhou No.1) and Pennisetum giganteum z.x.lin ( P. giganteum ) (the growth cycle of 5 months), and explore the relationship between microbial community structure and its function during MAD process. The results showed that cumulative biogas production and cumulative methane content Lvzhou No. 1 (370.37 mL/g VS and 280.08 mL/g VS) with richer nutrition were higher than those of P. giganteum (313.04 mL/g VS and 233.78 mL/g VS) within 30 days of MAD. And the maximum methane concentration could increase to 78% and 75%, respectively. The volatile fatty acid (VFA) of Lvzhou No. 1 and P. giganteum s showed a trend of increasing at first then decreasing, and reached the production peak on the first day (1372.40 mg/L) and second day (1061.18 mg/L), respectively. Hemicellulose of both was preferentially degraded with the highest degradation rate (48.27~77.45%). At last, the microbial community analysis suggested that the dominant bacteria in the MAD system at the phylum level belonged to Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Euryarchaeota. Among them, unidentified _ Clostridiales and Ruminofilibacter exhibited dominance in the production of acidic substances in this system, and methanogenic function was mainly associated with Methanosaeta . In conclusion, this study would provide new evidence for MAD of JUNCAO as new energy resources, which would pave the way for large-scale MAD of energy plants in the future. Graphical Abstract 
Abiotic stresses are responsible for nearly 90% of all yield losses, around 40% of which are due to drought. Most cereal crops, the mainstay of agricultural production in many countries, are sensitive to drought. Plant resistance to drought is the result of numerous stress-protective systems, among which the antioxidant system occupies a special place. This review considers the causes of increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in plants under water deficit, as well as their involvement in drought signal transduction. Examples of the involvement of antioxidant system components in cell signaling processes are considered. It is noted that antioxidants, in particular, are involved in signaling through changes in sulfhydryl homeostasis (RSH, RS-SR, and RSOH) and glutathionylation mode of specific proteins. Particular attention is paid to the contribution of specific enzymatic and low-molecular-mass antioxidants in the protection of various types of cereals from oxidative stress caused by drought. The role of compounds that are not classical antioxidants, such as proline, polyamines, sugars in protection against oxidative damage is considered. The review critically analyzes data on the relationship between the status of antioxidant system and drought resistance of cereals. It also briefly discusses the improvement of antioxidant system of plants through the transformation of genes of appropriate enzymes or transcription factors.
There are stringent EU regulatory requirements to assess pesticide exposure to bystanders and residents to direct spray drift. A “light clothing” adjustment factor (AF) of 0.82 is applied in the exposure assessment, based on simple assumptions for covered body surface and penetration through clothing. To assess the appropriateness of the AF, we collated data from 32 field studies. The mean and 25th percentile % reduction from ordinary light clothing (“reduction %”) in children and adults for all crops and standard and drift-reducing nozzles were 42.7% and 36.2%, resulting in AF of 0.573 and 0.638, respectively. Sources of variation were investigated, e.g. crop type, leaf coverage, buffer, spray pressure, and nozzle type, which indicated that reduction % could be impacted by several conditions. The reduction % is similar between crops; therefore, a single AF value covering all crops can be derived. One exception was for early-stage vineyard scenarios (the reduction % is lower (27%) than late stage (42–47%)) and could be considered individually to avoid unnecessary conservatism for the other scenarios. This evaluation demonstrates the current AF to be overly precautionary, and a more realistic, exposure scenario-relevant value could be applied for bystander/resident risk assessments.
Cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellite (CLCuMuB) encodes βC1 protein that induces disease symptoms in different monopartite begomovirus/betasatellite complexes. Iranian isolate of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV[Ab]) is a monopartite begomovirus without any associated betasatellite. It causes either no or mild symptoms in Nicotiana glutinosa . At the present study, the possibility of symptom induction by CLCuMuB-encoded βC1 was investigated by employing TYLCV[Ab]/ N. glutinosa pathosystem. N. glutinosa plants were agroinoculated with TYLCV[Ab], TYLCV[Ab] + CLCuMuB and TYLCV[Ab] + CLCuMuBΔC1 (deleted βC1 ORF). The expression level of two defensive genes, NPR1 and CAT1 was determined at 10 and 40 days' post-inoculation (dpi) using quantitative real time-PCR. The transcription level of CAT1 remained unchanged, while NPR1 expression was upregulated upon agroinoculation by TYLCV[Ab] + CLCuMuB. As a positive regulator of SA-dependent gene expression, NPR1 transcript level in plants agroinoculated with TYLCV[Ab] + CLCuMuB was 2 and 1.9-fold higher than that in plants agroinoculated with TYLCV[Ab] or TYLCV[Ab] + CLCuMuBΔC1 at 10 dpi, respectively. NPR1 transcript level was also found to be 1.8 and 1.7-fold higher at 40 dpi. Furthermore, disease symptoms were evaluated in the plants pre-treated with jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) hormones. Symptoms severity was significantly decreased in plants infected with TYLCV[Ab] + CLCuMuB when plants were pre-treated by JA, while pre-treatment with SA led to an increase in disease symptoms. As a result, the increased transcript level of a positive regulator of SA-dependent gene ( NPR1 ) and severe symptoms caused by the spraying of SA suggest that βC1 induces disease symptoms in N. glutinosa through a SA-dependent pathway.
Purpose The constantly changing global environment causes abiotic stressors, which have a negative influence on plant development and output. Among abiotic pressures, soil salinity is a major impediment to meeting global food demands while also ensuring sustainable agriculture. To address this issue, the current study sought multi-functional microbial inoculants from challenging habitats that can work together to alleviate salt stress. Methods To pre-isolate plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB), samples were collected from the halotolerant plant Suaeda nudiflora found in saline desert soil. Isolates were screened for morphological, biochemical, and molecular characterization and in planta screening under greenhouse conditions. Results Endophytic Bacillus safensis (BS) and rhizospheric Bacillus haynesii (BH) strains showed significant plant growth-promoting properties under in vitro conditions and were further examined in a greenhouse for the growth promotion of the Amaranthus viridis plantlets under salinity (4 ds m^−1 and 6 ds m^−1) conditions. Both strains were able to produce gibberellic acid, indole-3-acetic acid, hydrogen cyanide, ammonia, 1-amino cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase, exopolysaccharides, protease, chitinase, amylase, cellulase, and solubilized minerals such as phosphorous, zinc, and potassium. Stain BS was able to produce siderophore, while strain BH was able to fix nitrogen and produce pectinase. Both strains were effective under abiotic stress conditions such as pH, temperature, salt, and drought. Conclusion The application of halotolerant multi-trait PGPB is a viable and environmentally beneficial strategy for improving salt tolerance in plants. Consortiums were found to be more effective than single-strain inoculation at promoting plant development in salinity, and they have the potential to be developed further as a unique bioformulation product.
Bioactivity-guided fractionation of F. drupacea Thunb. extract revealed that the water fraction (FDWF) increased pH of the artificial gastric juice from 1.2 to 5.67 ± 0.015. The gastroprotective effect of FDWF against ulcer induced by ethanol was evaluated in rats. In ulcerogenic rats, increase in the gastric juice volume and ulcer lesions, and decrease in the gastric pH were evident. However, pretreatment with FDWF (100 mg/kg b.wt., p.o.) significantly inhibited lesion index, reduced gastric juice volume by 56.09% and increased gastric pH value. When given after ethanol, the same dose of FDWF led to significant healing of the gastric ulcer, with 75.60% reduction of gastric juice volume, and increase in pH value. In both prophylactic and therapeutic-treated groups, the level of superoxide dismutase and reduced glutathione in gastric homogenate were increased, while that of malondialdehyde was decreased. Also, the levels of succinate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase were increased, while that of acid phosphatase was decreased. In addition, the inflammatory markers; IL-10 and PGE2 were significantly increased. The histopathological results confirmed the above findings and indicated that the antiulcer effect of FDWF is mediated, at least in part, through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Twenty-three compounds were tentatively identified in FDWF using UPLC−PDA−ESI–MS/MS and most of them were found to be phenolic acid derivatives. FDWF was standardized to contain 23.66 ± 2.62 mg/g and 8.86 ± 0.29 mg/g of quinic acid and chlorogenic acid, respectively. Accordingly, FDWF is a potential natural product that could increase the healing of gastric mucosal injury and prevents the development of ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury in rats.
Globally, large herbivores (e.g., cattle, elk) graze over 2.6 billion hectares of land. These lands can also be used to conserve pollinators that rely on similar resources, specifically diverse plant communities. Pollinator conservation will benefit from management in lands that are used for livestock grazing and wildlife conservation. However, maximizing ecosystem services provided in these areas is often nuanced and difficult. To improve our ability to support multiple ecosystem services in grazing lands, we reviewed published literature to investigate the mechanisms of indirect effects of large herbivores on pollinators via their resources (food plants, nesting sites). We used a framework from previous research on indirect effects of insect herbivores to explore and interpret how plant responses mediate large herbivore effects on pollinators through three mechanistic categories: resource abundance and availability, plant appearance, and plant chemistry. Using the broader conceptual model, we conducted a targeted literature review that found ~ 95% of studies investigating pollinators and large herbivores focused on resource abundance and availability. Consequently, more research is necessary to understand how large herbivores impact pollinators through multiple mechanisms. Future research could also test responses with both large herbivores and insect herbivores to determine their combined ecological consequences. This research will provide insights for managing large herbivores and pollinators simultaneously, while connecting concepts of pollinator ecology and grazing ecology. Filling research gaps on the mechanisms of indirect effects of large herbivores on pollinators will ultimately improve management of multiple ecosystem services and our ability to conserve declining pollinator species.
Anthracnose is a common disease that affects crops, and rapid diagnosis using computer vision technology can reduce economic losses. The convolutional neural network is still the mainstream crop disease detection and disease spot segmentation method. However, the method based on the convolutional neural network is not suitable for the detection and segmentation tasks with minor differences between crop lesions. In view of the instance characteristics that anthracnose lesions are mostly large in size, different in size, and regular in shape, the Path Aggregation Swin Transformer Network (PAST-Net), is proposed to achieve lesion segmentation and species detection of anthracnose simultaneously. First, the Swin Transformer is used as the backbone to extract features of input images. Second, the extracted lesion features are sequentially sent to the top-down feature pyramid network and the bottom-up augmentation path to retain the shallow network features to the greatest extent and improve the extraction ability of large-sized lesions. Next, the same proposal features from all levels are integrated using adaptive feature pooling. Finally, the box branch performs classification and bounding box regression, while the mask branch performs lesion segmentation. Experimental results show that PAST-Net improves the performance of both object detection and instance segmentation on the collected anthracnose dataset, with a recognition accuracy of 73.70% and a segmentation accuracy of 75.35%, which are 5.86% and 3.57% higher than the baseline, respectively.
Rhizoctonia solani (teleomorph: Thanatephorus cucumeris ) is a ubiquitous plant pathogen infects various agricultural and horticultural crops. In this investigation, isolates of R. solani were collected from collar-rot infected dhaincha plants and black scurf affected potato tubers from potato based crop rotation to determine their morphological variability, mycelial compatibility and cross-infectivity. Significant variations in cultural and morphological features were observed among and between the R. solani isolates from both the hosts. Dhaincha isolates grew faster than those potato isolates and hyphal width of both host isolates varied from 6.24 to 11.70 μm. Considerable variability was observed in sclerotial characteristics viz . sclerotia colour, size, intensity, and distribution pattern. Most of the dhaincha isolates produced macro (> 1.26 mm) size sclerotia while potato isolates formed micro (≤ 1.25 mm) size sclerotia. Hyphal interaction studies showed that all isolates from potato belonged to AG-3 and dhaincha isolates belonged to AG1-IA group. Mycelial compatibility studies revealed that 76.67% of pairing was compatible while 23.33% of pairing exhibited non-compatible interaction. Cross-infectivity test revealed that R. solani potato isolates did not infect dhaincha plants whereas dhaincha isolates showed the varied degree of pathogenicity on potato and Rhizoctonia -like atypical symptoms were observed on the tuber surface. In this study, we report the first time of R. solani AG composition infecting potato in dhaincha-potato rotation in India. The outcomes of this study will be helpful for developing management strategies and breeding programs on varietal evaluation for effective control of Rhizoctonia diseases of potatoes.
The present study evaluated the anaerobic co-fermentation of brewery by-products for hydrogen production. The biochemical hydrogen potential was conducted at thermophilic (55 °C) and acidogenic conditions (pH around 5) mixing brewery wastewater, brewer’s spent grains (BSG), and sludge from the brewery wastewater treatment plant. The results revealed that the removal efficiency of total volatile solids (TVS) reached a maximum of 30.86%. The dominant volatile fatty acids produced were acetic (3648.86 mg L^−1) and butyric (2300.22 mg L^−1), while propionic (765.56 mg L^−1) and isovaleric (827.80 mg L^−1) were detected in much lower amounts. The reactor operated only with wastewater decreased the nitrogen concentration at the end of co-fermentation (190 mg N–NH_3 L^−1), while the addition of BSG promoted an increase of nitrogen (> 300 mg N–NH_3 L^−1). The highest hydrogen yield was obtained for the reactor operated only with wastewater (25.11 mL H_2 g^−1 TVS), and the yield decreased according to the addition of BSG, reaching 9.55 mL H_2 g^−1 TVS for the reactor containing 17.5% of BSG. The suppression of hydrogen production with BSG addition can be associated with the ammonia inhibition. The Gompertz, Cone, and first-order kinetic models predicted the hydrogen production with a difference lower than 1.5% of the experimental volume obtained. Finally, this study advanced our knowledge regarding the use of BSG and the inhibition of hydrogen production due to excessive ammonia generation during the dark fermentation of brewery by-products.

Previous studies have demonstrated the impact of potassium humate (KH) and chitosan (CH) on ameliorating drought effects, but their combined applications in promoting these benefits are still unfound. Therefore, the current study aims to evaluate the efficacy of KH and CH on corn growth, yield, nutrient contents, and water productivity under full and limited irrigation conditions. Under the drip irrigation system, a split-plot experiment was performed with three replications in the second week of February in the seasons of 2021 and 2022. The main plot was equipped with a valve and a flow emitter to control the amount of the targeted irrigation levels (full irrigation and limited irrigation from the development stage onwards), as well as four foliar applications in the subplot (0, CH 500 mg l^−1, KH 3000 mg l^−1, and CH 500 mg l^−1 + KH 3000 mg l^−1). It was found that separate foliar applications of KH or combined foliar applications of KH + CH had a significant impact on the most examined traits. However, compared to the control, adopting limited irrigation and applying combined applications thereof have significantly increased iron, zinc, manganese, oil, protein, yield, and water productivity. In addition, this combination decreased proline, and the maximum reduction was observed for the combined application with adopting full irrigation. In arid regions, the researcher recommends treating stressed plants with combined foliar applications of KH + CH, which could help plants overcome the negative effects of drought and attain the highest yield and water productivity.
Guava is an important commercial fruit crop grown in the subtropical and tropical regions of the world. India is world’s largest guava producer and accounts for 45.22% of global production. Recent reports from several parts of India suggest that guava orchards are infested with root-knot nematodes (RKNs) Meloidogyne enterolobii , M. incognita and M. javanica . However, limited information is available on the RKNs affecting guava in the northern states of India. Here, we surveyed 25 orchards in three important guava-producing north-Indian states of Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. Eleven samples were positive for RKN, whereas fourteen contained no RKN. All six samples from Uttarakhand, four out of fourteen orchards of Haryana, and one out of five surveyed orchards in Uttar Pradesh showed RKN infection. The infected young plants did not show disease symptoms, but the older plants showed yellowing and browning of the leaves with necrosis in the margins, stunted plant growth, drooping of leaves with bare twigs, and roots with simple and compound galls depending on the severity of the infection. Morphological identification by observing the RKN female’s posterior cuticular patterns and molecular identification using species-specific markers confirmed the identity of the nematode species as M. enterolobii . Our study confirms the presence of M. enterolobii in previously unreported areas of the north Indian states of Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. More information on the extent of the spread of M. enterolobii must be generated and used to prevent the further spread of this nematode to newer areas.
The pollen grain cell wall is a highly specialized structure composed of distinct layers formed through complex developmental pathways. The production of the innermost intine layer, composed of cellulose, pectin and other polymers, is particularly poorly understood. Here we demonstrate an important and specific role for the hydroxyproline O-arabinosyltransferase (HPAT) FIN4 in tomato intine development. HPATs are plant-specific enzymes which initiate glycosylation of certain cell wall structural proteins and signaling peptides. FIN4 was expressed throughout pollen development in both the developing pollen and surrounding tapetal cells. A fin4 mutant with a partial deletion of the catalytic domain displayed significantly reduced male fertility in vivo and compromised pollen hydration and germination in vitro. However, fin4 pollen that successfully germinated formed morphologically normal pollen tubes with the same growth rate as the wild-type pollen. When we examined mature fin4 pollen, we found they were cytologically normal, and formed morphologically normal exine, but produced significantly thinner intine. During intine deposition at the late stages of pollen development we found fin4 pollen had altered polymer deposition, including reduced cellulose and increased detection of pectin, specifically homogalacturonan with both low and high degrees of methylesterification. Therefore, FIN4 plays an important role in intine formation and, in turn pollen hydration and germination and the process of intine formation involves dynamic changes in the developing pollen cell wall.
While previous studies have demonstrated the positive effects of low cobalt (CB) levels and chitosan (CH) on yield and nutrient status, information about their individual and combined applications on plants under stress is still lacking. Therefore, we conducted a study to investigate CB and CH impacts on mitigating water stress during growth stages and their effects on corn macronutrient uptake and yield. Four irrigation schemes were employed, including (1) control (full irrigation), (2) 70% of irrigation water during the vegetative stage, (3) 70% of irrigation water during the flowering stage, and (4) 85% of irrigation water during both the vegetative and flowering stages. The plants were treated with (7.5 mg l^−1) CB injected into the irrigation water and CH foliar application (500 mg l^−1), while distilled water was used as the control. Plants that were exposed to water stress during the flowering stage and treated with CB, or those subjected to water stress during the vegetative stage and treated with CH, showed increased macronutrient uptake and growth, which had a positive effect on yield and water use efficiency. However, when CB and CH were applied in combination, their potential to enhance these features depended on the pattern of water stress adopted. Overall, the application of CB and CH was effective in mitigating water stress, and their combined application was particularly effective when 70% of irrigation water was applied during the flowering stage. This approach resulted in the highest yield, macronutrient uptake, water use efficiency, and tolerance index.
Plant peroxidases are widely employed as biocatalysts in organic and inorganic compounds biotransformation. In the present study, a novel luffa peroxidase (LPrx) was extracted and purified to homogeneity from Luffa acutangula . The important physicochemical properties of an enzyme, such as optimum pH, temperature, molecular weight, pI, and amino acid sequences, were thoroughly investigated. The SDS-PAGE Gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF MS analysis were carried out to determine the molecular weight and the amino acid sequence of LPrx. The molecular weight of 37.7 kDa was obtained with a total of 332 amino acid sequences. The enzyme kinetics study was carried out using guaiacol as a substrate in the presence of H_2O_2. An inhibition study was carried out to explore the scope of LPrx in detecting heavy metal ions, such as Hg^2+, Pd^2+, Pb^2+, Ln^2+, and Ba^2+. The catalytic actions of LPrx in the present study revealed that it could effectively catalyze the oxidation of phenols, aromatic amine and the halogenation of halides. This communication proposed possible routes for LPrx-mediated bioconversion of phenols and aromatic amine.
Improper extraction of groundwater resources has led to a sharp decline in the water level of aquifers. To achieve sustainable management of groundwater, it is very important to simulate the amount of recharging an aquifer by considering the physical properties of the relevant basin (such as soil properties, land use, irrigation, climate data and unsaturated layer). In the present study, a groundwater modeling was accomplished to predict the recharge rate under the conditions of climate change and irrigation reduction. Meteorological parameters in the next period (2021–2050) were simulated by ten climate change models (GCMs) under emission scenarios. The combination of SWAT and MODFLOW models was also used to predict the groundwater recharge rate. The results of forecasting climatic parameters in the next period (2021–2050) indicated that the temperature will increase (0.66–1.68 °C) while the precipitation will decrease (4–14%). The recharge rate modeling revealed that recharge values in heavy soils are less estimated compared to that of the light soils of the region. Also, the average recharge rate of the whole aquifer in the next period under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios will decrease by 23 and 34%, respectively. The simulation of reducing the irrigation requirements on the recharging rate indicated that with a 30% reduction of irrigation, the average recharging rate of the whole plain will decrease by 12%. Therefore, it is recommended to apply policies to decrease irrigation requirements, such as the development of pressurized irrigation systems and the cultivation of low-consumption plants, to help balance the aquifer.
Soil salinity is a critical abiotic stress that poses threat to global agricultural production. Salinity induces osmotic and ionic stresses, which negatively affect the growth and development of plants. Exogenous applications of trace elements have demonstrated their possible role in overcoming the adverse effects of salt stress in plants. Selenium (Se) is one such candidate with tremendous potential of salt stresses alleviation in plants. In this context, the present study was conducted to evaluate the role of exogenous Se in mitigating salt stress in proso millet. Proso millet plants were subjected to salinity stress (150 mM NaCl) and three concentrations of Se (1 µM, 5 µM and 10 µM) as sodium selenite (Na_2SeO_3) was applied for mitigation in three increments within 2 weeks. Se (1 µM) improved the fresh weight by 44.14%, biomass accumulation by 46.78%, shoot length by 95.42%, and root length by 19.45%, of proso millet plants under 150 mM NaCl stress. Se enhanced the activity of antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, guaiacol peroxidases, glutathione-S-transferases and glutathione reductase by 24.37%, 28.59%, 18.99%, 45.46%, 24.5% and 11.37%, respectively. It also improved levels of osmolytes like proline, glycine betaine and total soluble sugar by 37.98%, 17.33% and 22.31% respectively and decreased H_2O_2 content by 20.68%. Se treatment increased the expression of SOS1 , SOS2 , SOS3 , HKT and NHX transporters by 3.1, 6.1, 3.4, 3.1 and 2.8-fold respectively. In conclusion, Se in low doses improved the plant’s defense mechanisms by boosting the antioxidant machinery and regulating Na^+ transporters, thereby mitigated the adverse effects of salinity stress.
This study aimed to assess rural household food security status in the villages of Kermanshah County using sustainable livelihoods framework by an exploratory sequential mixed-methods approach. In this research, qualitative and quantitative data were collected and analyzed in two separate phases. In qualitative research, change agents and the Delphi technique are employed to identify and classify these factors and prioritize the effects of them on the food security status of rural households. In the second phase, the theoretical basis for the structural model in the quantitative investigation, based on sustainable livelihoods framework, and the results of the qualitative section were added to the model. Bayesian structural equation modeling is used in model presentation. The results indicate that among the food security dimensions, stability (0.738) and among the sustainable livelihood framework factors, social capital (0.316) have the greatest impact on food security status. Moreover, the dimensions of natural capital (0.172), human capital (0.133), financial capital (0.081), livelihood strategies (0.075), vulnerability patterns (-0.046), transformative structures and processes (0.019) and physical capital (0.012) are the most effective factors on the food security status of households, respectively. In addition, "participation in cooperative activities with other villagers", "social integration with other rural members", "the crime rate in the village," and "more preference for living in rural area" had the greatest effect on the formation of social capital. Hence, social empowerment, use of diverse cropping pattern and access to education in the region are necessary to improve food security development programs. Enhancing participation in cooperative activities with other rural households and encouraging social integration with members from other villages are the most important recommendations in this research.
Plant structural defenses such as trichomes exert a significant selection pressure on insect herbivores. However, whether variation in structural defense traits affects common herbivores in related plant species is less understood. Here, we examined the role of trichomes in plant–herbivore interactions in two commonly cultivated members in Cucurbitaceae: bottle gourd ( Lagenaria siceraria ) and cucumber ( Cucumis sativa ). In common garden experiments when the two species were grown together, we observed that they differed in their attractiveness to four major herbivore species ( Trichoplusia ni , Acalymma vittatum , Diaphania indica , and Anasa tristis ) and, consequently, their feeding behavior. We found that L. siceraria consistently harbored less herbivores, and the two lepidopteran herbivores ( T. ni and D. indica ) were found to take significantly longer time to commence feeding on them, a primary mode of pre-ingestive defense function of trichomes. To tease apart structural and chemical modes of defenses, we first used scanning electron microscopy to identify, quantify, and measure trichome traits including their morphology and density. We found that C. sativa has significantly lower number of trichomes compared to L. siceraria , regardless of trichome type and leaf surface. We then used artificial diet enriched with trichomes as caterpillar food and found that trichomes from these two species differentially affected growth and development of T. ni showing cascading effects of trichomes. Taken together, we show that trichomes, independent of chemical defenses, are an effective pre- and post-ingestive defense strategy against herbivores with negative consequences for their feeding, growth, and development.
The germination process and seedling growth are crucial stages in the life history of a plant that are severely affected in the face of salinity, osmotic, and extreme temperature conditions. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the efficacy of osmopriming with calcium chloride (CaCl_2) on the tolerance responses of biological parameters of germination to the combined temperature (T) and sodium chloride (NaCl)-induced osmotic potential (Ψ) conditions using a developed hydrotime model. The germination behavior of Ca^2+-primed and non-primed seeds was analyzed at different T (1, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 °C) and NaCl-induced Ψ (0, − 0.4, − 0.8, − 1.2, − 1.6, − 2, and − 2.4 MPa) conditions. According to the hydrotime model, Ca^2+-primed seeds demonstrated a higher tolerance to the joint impacts of chilling and NaCl-induced osmotic conditions than those of non-primed ones. Generally, the priming treatment significantly ameliorated the extent, timing, uniformity of germination, and seedling vigor index at all examined hydro-thermal conditions compared with control seeds. This significance was associated with shifted ecophysiological parameters regarding hydrotime (ϴ_H), base water potential (Ψ_b), time taken for germination of a specific percentile (t_(g)), and standard deviation of hydrotime (σ_ϴ) toward the lower values following Ca^2+-priming treatment, indicating a greater salinity tolerance. Hence, the presented biological parameters can easily be used to predict the physiological changes of germination under environmental factors over time. Also, results suggest that recommended Ca^2+-priming treatment could be a time- and cost-effective method for improving quinoa cultivation in salt agriculture, especially in arid lands.
The removal of organic matter from Pisco production wastewater was evaluated using coagulation/flocculation, filtration as a pre-treatment, and solar photo-Fenton, with the use of two types of photoreactors: compound parabolic collectors (CPC) and flat plate (FP), with and without utilizing the ozonation process. The overall removal efficiency for chemical oxygen demand (COD) was 63% and 15% using FP and CPC, respectively. Also, for the overall removal efficiency of polyphenols, a percentage of 73% and 43% were obtained using FP and CPC, respectively. When ozone was used in the solar photoreactors, the resulting trends were similar. COD and polyphenol removal, using an FP photoreactor in the solar photo-Fenton/O_3 process, resulted in values of 98.8% and 86.2% after the process. COD and polyphenol removal, using solar photo-Fenton/O_3 process in a CPC, resulted in values of 49.5% and 72.4%, respectively. The economic indicators of annual worth and economic treatment capacity established that FP reactors represent lower costs than CPCs. These results were corroborated by the economic analyses of the evolution of costs versus COD removed as well as by the cash flow diagrams projected for 5, 10, and 15 years.
Spotted pod borer,  Maruca vitrata (F.), is one of the severe threats to grain legumes in the tropics and subtropics owing to its destructiveness and broad host range. It is imperative to look for safer alternatives for its management, such as the utilization of host plant resistance which can be induced upon the exogenous application of jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA). We studied the changes induced in the digestive and detoxifying enzymes of M. vitrata upon its feeding on JA and SA-treated pigeonpea plants in comparison with the untreated plants. Both JA and SA induced a defense response in pigeonpea plants against M. vitrata , which in turn affected the pest’s development and physiology. The effect on the digestive enzymes (amylase, total proteases, elastase, lactate dehydrogenase) and developmental parameters (larval duration, larval weight, pupal weight, pupal percent, adult emergence and adult longevity) of M. vitrata was more pronounced and significant in the plants pre-treated with JA and then infested with M. vitrata after 12 h of JA application, compared to other treatments and untreated plants. The resistant genotype, AL 1747 responded better to the exogenous application of elicitors and M. vitrata infestation than the susceptible genotype MN 1. As a counter-response to induced plant defenses, an increase in the activity of glutathione-S-transferases (GST) and glucose oxidase (GOX) enzymes was observed in M. vitrata . Despite elevating its GOX activity upon elicitor application, the pod borer was unable to overcome the induced pigeonpea defences consequent of elicitor application as was indicated by its reduced larval weight and other biological parameters. SA also altered the activities of digestive and defense-related enzymes in M. vitrata ; however, the effect was not as pronounced as JA. Both JA and SA seem to be involved in triggering the pigeonpea defenses and their exogenous application can be utilized to develop sustainable pest management strategies against M. vitrata .
Plant-based proteins have shown great potential as an alternative substitute for animal proteins to meet the increasing global demand. Nevertheless, several limitations mitigate plant-based protein application and utilization. As a panacea to meeting the market demand, it is imperative to modify plant-based proteins to produce improved quality and techno-functionalities compared to conventional animal protein ingredients. Enzymatic, chemical, and physical modifications have been used for plant-based proteins, which have shown exciting results in improving their techno-functional properties, digestibility, and inherent allergenicity. Among these modification methods, the low-cost, limited time, high sensitivity, and high reproducibility give enzymatic modification leverage over chemical and physical methods. This review gave a concise summary of the advantages and disadvantages of enzymatic modifications. The efficacy of enzymatic modification in producing protein ingredients from plant sources with improved techno-functional properties, digestibility, and alleviated allergenicity was discussed. Furthermore, the application of enzymatic modification in the production of bioactive compounds with health-beneficial properties adds in no small measure to the novelty of this review.
The optimal elemental nutrition is the key to obtain high quality crop yields, presently and more so in future climate. Plants need a number of elements spanning the periodic table for their overall growth and development, including carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), potassium (K), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) etc. Some of these elements are required in large amounts and are either easily available or provided to plants via external supply. The elements like Zn, Cu, iron (Fe) etc. are required in lesser amounts ranging from trace to ultratrace levels. Additionally, there are other elements, known as beneficial elements, which are although not essential but improve growth and stress tolerance of plants; for example selenium (Se) and silicon (Si). Various elements take part in plant metabolic activities as constituent of enzymes like Se in glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductase, nickel (Ni) in urease and glyoxalase I, Zn and Cu in superoxide dismutases and molybdenum (Mo) in nitrate reductase. Certain elements participate in electron transport in mitochondria and chloroplasts and allow smooth operation of photosynthetic and respiratory processes. In addition, an optimum supply of beneficial and ultratrace elements help plants’ tackle various abiotic as well as biotic stresses. Thus, maintaining a fine balance of plant mineral nutrition is a sustainable approach to ameliorate crop health and yield. The present review presents diverse roles of various essential and beneficial trace and ultratrace elements in planta and discusses future directions of research on these elements in plants.
Abstract In this study, cheese whey and olive mill wastewater were investigated as potential feedstocks for producing bacterial cellulose by using acetic acid bacteria strains. Organic acids and phenolic compounds composition were assayed by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction were used to investigate modifications in bacterial cellulose chemical and morphological structure. Cheese whey was the most efficient feedstock in terms of bacterial cellulose yield (0.300 g of bacterial cellulose/gram of carbon source consumed). Bacterial cellulose produced in olive mill wastewater presented a more well-defined network compared to pellicles produced in cheese whey, resulting in a smaller fiber diameter in most cases. The analysis of bacterial cellulose chemical structure highlighted the presence of different chemical bonds likely to be caused by the adsorption of olive mill wastewater and cheese whey components. The crystallinity ranged from 45.72 to 80.82%. The acetic acid bacteria strains used in this study were characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, allowing to assign them to Komagataeibacter xylinus and Komagataeibacter rhaeticus species. This study proves the suitability to perform sustainable bioprocesses for producing bacterial cellulose, combining the valorisation of agro-wastes with microbial conversions carried out by acetic acid bacteria. The high versatility in terms of yield, morphology, and fiber diameters obtained in cheese whey and olive mill wastewater contribute to set up fundamental criteria for developing customized bioprocesses depending on the final use of the bacterial cellulose. Key points • Cheese whey and olive mill wastewater can be used for bacterial cellulose production. • Bacterial cellulose structure is dependent on the culture medium. • Komagataeibacter strains support the agro-waste conversion in bacterial cellulose.
Soil organic growing media for mat-type paddy seedling cultivation is considered the best option in the country for its capacity to help proficient and concentrated paddy plant production rapidly and uniformly. The primary goal of this review is to describe an examination of the effects of soil organic growing media on paddy seedling growth, development, quality, and quantity in mat-type paddy nurseries. According to a review of the research, paddy yield is higher for plants grown in multiple growing media than for plants grown in soil alone. Until relatively recently, the fundamental intention in choosing the growing materials in the growing media depended on performance and monetary opinions. Expanding dread over the ecological effects to evaluate more environmentally seedling growth materials. It is critical to recognize emphatic and environmentally sustainable growing materials for paddy seedling growing media in order to ensure sustained growth and development of soil organic cultivation. In this review, we describe the factors that influence the selection of growing media and remark on the most often employed soil organic elements in relation to them. We explain some of the renewable, elementary, and waste materials that have been investigated thus far, emphasizing their benefits and defiance. We explain a confirmation-based logic for a more compatible perspective to characterizing growing media and for a refiner discerning the practical and economic tangibility of modern soil organic growing media cultivation system for mat-type paddy seedling nurseries in response to the need for researchers to recognize promising new growing materials.
Genomics research of Populus deltoides , an important timber species that is widely planted worldwide, is an important part of poplar breeding. Currently, the nuclear and chloroplast genome of P. deltoides have been sequenced, but its mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) has not been reported. To further explore the evolution and phylogeny of P. deltoides , the mitogenome of P. deltoides I-69 was assembled using reads from Nanopore and Illumina sequencing platforms and found to consist of 802,637 bp and three circular chromosomes (336,205, 280,841, and 185,591 bp) containing 58 genes (34 protein-coding genes, 21 tRNA genes, and 3 rRNA genes). RNA analysis in combination with several species showed significantly fewer RNA editing sites in the mitogenomes of poplar and other angiosperms than in gymnosperms. Sequence transfer analysis showed extensive mitogenome rearrangements in Populus species, and with evolution from lower to higher plants, tRNA transfer from chloroplasts to mitochondria became increasingly frequent. In a phylogenetic analysis, the evolutionary status of P. deltoides was determined, and the section Populus was supported. Our results based on the first report of a multi-circular conformation of the Populus mitogenome provide a basis for further study of the evolution and genetics of P. deltoides and other Populus species and for breeding programs.
Nutritional deficiency in plants triggers significant economic losses for important crops. As a direct consequence, it broadly affects plant growth, and photosynthetic efficiency is strongly influenced by nutritional imbalance. To deepen our understanding of how nutritional deficiencies affects photosynthesis, we removed the supply of macronutrients (N, P, K, Ca, S) one element at a time at hydroponic tobacco cultivation. Essential macronutrient deficiencies affected both photochemical and carboxylative steps of photosynthesis. In addition, interference on light absorption, energy quenching and the electron transport chain influenced carbon reactions. In particular, deficiencies in N and S depleted potential CO_2 assimilation, while Ca deficiency affected CO_2 diffusion (mainly g _s), and light reactions were affected as well. P deficiency promoted severe damage to the antenna complexes and reaction centres of the photosystems. All deficiencies increased energy dissipation (ɸDo) and nonphotochemical dissipation (Kn). Reduction of ETR and probability of electron transport of QA^− for plastoquinone (ΨEo and ɸEo) following distinct levels of damages to ETC were observed.
Obesity is one of the principal reasons behind a wide range of metabolic diseases and dramatic health complications. Recent studies shed the light on chia ( Salvia hispanica L., Lamiaceae) and quinoa ( Chenopodium quinoa Willd., Amaranthaceae) seeds and identified them as products of utmost health benefits. The present study was designed to explore the molecular mechanisms of the hydroalcoholic extract of those seeds in weight management. Rats were divided randomly into two main groups: control and treated. The control groups received regular chow diet, high-fat diet, and green tea. The treated groups received high-fat diet and chia or quinoa extracts. Results revealed that the seeds showed hepatoprotective effects and anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, and modulated leptin, adiponectin, serum lipid, and glycemic profiles. Effects are further consolidated by normal hepatic tissue architecture upon histopathological examination. Moreover, modulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors-γ transcriptional activity via activation of 5′AMP-activated protein kinase and suppression of nuclear expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c in obese rats as compared to green tea were demonstrated. Characterization of the major secondary bioactive metabolites was done using HPLC/PDA/ESI-MS/MS. Our study advocates evidence-based study on nutrition and health claims on the use of chia and quinoa extracts as nutraceutical supplements for promoting weight wellness and alleviating its related metabolic disorders.
The current era of industrialization includes a constantly increasing demand for plastic products, but because plastics are rarely recycled and are not biodegradable plastic pollution or “white pollution” has been the result. The consumption of petroleum-based plastics will be 20% of global annual oil by 2050, and thus there is an inevitable need to find an innovative solution to reduce plastic pollution. The biodegradable and environmentally benign bioplastics are suitable alternative to fossil-based plastics in the market due to sustainability, less carbon footprint, lower toxicity and high degradability rate. Microalgal species is an innovative approach to be explored and improved for bioplastic production. Microalgae are generally present in abundant quantity in our ecosystem, and polysaccharide in the algae can be processed and utilized to make biopolymers. Also, these species have a high growth rate and can be easily cultivated in wastewater streams. The review aims to determine the recent status of bioplastic production techniques from microalgal species and also reveal optimization opportunities involved in the process. Several strategies for bioplastic production from algal biomass are being discussed nowadays, and the most prominent are “with blending” (blending of algal biomass with bioplastics and starch) and “without blending” (microalgae as a feedstock for polyhydroxyalkanoates production). The advanced research on modern bioengineering techniques and well-established genetic tools like CRISPR–Cas9 should be encouraged to develop recombinant microalgae strains with elevated levels of PHA/PHB inside the cell.
Indonesia is one of the biggest cocoa producers in the world with total production 240,000 tons by 2019. Meanwhile, we have about 400,000 tons cocoa pod husk (CPH). CPH biomass is a serious problem in Indonesia, but at the same time, it is also an important, challenging, and environmental renewable source for bioproduction. Therefore, it becomes a focus of interest in this research aiming to utilize of CPH as renewable substrate for citric acid production. The solid-state fermentation (SSF) approach was applied to CPH using Aspergillus niger Tiegh F359 for produce citric acid. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the citric acid production with water concentration, nitrogen concentration, and fermentation time as variable factors. Around 7530 ppm citric acid was produced from 1 g CPH as a carbon source. Entirely, this study has succeeded in optimizing citric acid production by using SSF using A. niger Tiegh F359 and providing a fundamental study for CPH as low-cost renewable substrate for bioproduct production and future endeavors.
Nitrogen (N) and zinc (Zn) play a crucial role in determining and improving the quantitative and qualitative yields of the crops. On the other hand, high mobility of N and its role in the pollution of environment and groundwater resources have caused many problems. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to investigate the effect of different methods of application of Zn on crop yield, protein content, and micronutrient concentrations (Zn, Fe and Mn) in rainfed wheat grain under reduced soil N fertilizer supply. The experiment was conducted using the factorial arrangement of randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications (2017–2020). The application treatments of N were considered as N_0, N_30, N_60, and N_90 kg ha^−1 from the urea source and Zn application treatments include Zn_0, Zn_10, Zn_20, Zn_fo, Zn_10-Zn_fo, and Zn_20-Zn_fo kg ha^−1 from the Zn sulfate. The results revealed that the effect of N and Zn consumptions on grain yield and total dry matter (TDM) were significant at the level of 1%. The highest grain yield and TDM (3435.3 and 7161.8 kg ha^−1) were obtained from N_30-Zn_fo treatment. Also, the highest protein content related to N_60Zn_20 was equal to 13.4 percent. Grain Zn bioavailability increased with decreasing the soil N rates, but decreased after foliar application of Zn fertilizers. Foliar application significantly increased phytic acid (PA), Fe and Mn concentrations in grain, and the amounts of these increases were greater when Zn_fo was lonely applied or N_30-Zn_fo and N_60-Zn_fo was used. It was concluded that with Zn_fo application in rainfed wheat cultivation, the N fertilizer supply was reduced by 50%. Therefore, under this condition, the use of N_60 is recommended.
Bio-based nonwoven products are potentially more sustainable with a lower environmental impact than the current generation of petrochemical nonwovens. This work aims to examine the structure and performance of an air-laid sheet composed of defibrated Eucalyptus pulp and polylactic acid (PLA) fibers. In this work, Eucalyptus pulp dry fibers were prepared through two different methodologies, yielding fibers with distinct morphological properties. In an air-laid former, specially conceived for this work, sheets with a grammage of 100 g m^−2 were prepared from fiber blends with moisture to aid in the consolidation. The resulting air-laid sheets were characterized by their structural, mechanical, and water sorption properties. The results showed that Eucalyptus fibers with fewer fines and fiber deformations yielded more absorbent sheets. The high fines group gave higher sheet strength. 30% of PLA fiber gave the best combination of strength and absorption capacity and stretch at break. The improvement in bulk, dry and wet strength was possible for air-laid sheets produced from the Eucalyptus /PLA mixture. The results showed that PLA has a strong interaction with the sheet fines, affecting consolidation and performance of the final product.
Innovative, renewable and cost-effective porous composites were developed for integrating high fire safety and antibacterial properties for thermoplastic polymers. Sustainable porous carbon sheets were developed from plum stones as fruits-by-products via single carbonization step affording dual environmental and economic benefits. The as-developed porous carbon own specific surface area of 165 m^2 g^−1 which is characteristic of mesoporous feature of an average mesopore size of 2.1 nm, in addition to naturally doped nitrogen species. The obtained porous carbons sheets were dispersed in different mass loadings in to polystyrene matrix-producing polymer composites. Interestingly, SnO_2 microsphere of an average size of 2 µm was synthesized on the surface of developed porous carbon sheets producing new porous composites. The new composites were elucidated using XRD, FT-IR and SEM–EDS. Then, the developed composites were dispersed in polystyrene. The mass loadings were altered and studied. The progress in fire safety, thermal stability and antibacterial properties for developed polymer composites was studied. The flame retardancy of the new composites was significantly improved achieving rate of burning of 20.5 mm min^−1 compared to 46.5 mm min^−1 for blank polymer. This superior flame retardancy was corroborated by recording LOI value of 24.5% compared to 18% for virgin polymer. This attained flame retardancy was ascribed to the synergistic effect between porous carbon sheets contained nitrogen and SnO_2 microsphere. The new composites afford promising inhibition for bacterial growth achieving clear antibacterial inhibition zone of 11 mm compared to zero for blank sample. The flame retardancy action was studied and elucidated.
Abstract Carbon stable isotope breath tests offer new opportunities to better understand gastrointestinal function in health and disease. However, it is often not clear how to isolate information about a gastrointestinal or metabolic process of interest from a breath test curve, and it is generally unknown how well summary statistics from empirical curve fitting correlate with underlying biological rates. We developed a framework that can be used to make mechanistic inference about the metabolic rates underlying a ^13C breath test curve, and we applied it to a pilot study of ^13C-sucrose breath test in 20 healthy adults. Starting from a standard conceptual model of sucrose metabolism, we determined the structural and practical identifiability of the model, using algebra and profile likelihoods, respectively, and we used these results to develop a reduced, identifiable model as a function of a gamma-distributed process; a slower, rate-limiting process; and a scaling term related to the fraction of the substrate that is exhaled as opposed to sequestered or excreted through urine. We demonstrated how the identifiable model parameters impacted curve dynamics and how these parameters correlated with commonly used breath test summary measures. Our work develops a better understanding of how the underlying biological processes impact different aspect of ^13C breath test curves, enhancing the clinical and research potential of these ^13C breath tests.

Activated carbon foams (ACFs) have been successfully prepared by foaming sucrose with Zn nitrate and further chemical activation with H_3PO_4. The effect of the foaming agent (Zn) concentration and the activation temperature on the surface chemistry, porosity, and morphology were investigated. The ACFs reveal high specific surface area, non-uniform variable porous structure, and high oxygen content. The ACFs represent high specific capacitance and very low equivalent serial resistance (ESR) values as electrode material. The ACF obtained at 600 °C has a specific capacitance of 205.4 F/g at 1 A/g constant current density. The pseudocapacitive contribution of oxygen-containing surface functional groups was proved by CV curves at slow scan rates. The high performance of the ACFs may be attributed not only to the high surface area, and hetero-atom-containing SGFs but also to the unique surface morphology which originated from the release of gaseous products during the foaming process.
In recent times use of different technologies for intelligent crop production is growing. To increase the production of crops, diagnosing a plant disease is very important. Plant diseases can be identified using various techniques like image processing, machine learning, deep learning, etc. Among these techniques deep learning, especially deep learning using convolutional neural networks (CNN) has proved to be more efficient in recent years compared to other methods. This manuscript focuses mainly on the diseases affecting on eleven (11) different plants and how the diseases can be identified from plant leaf images using CNN based deep learning models. This review can help the researchers to get a brief overview of how state-of-the-art CNN models can be used for disease diagnosis in plants, and an overview of the state-of-the-art studies that have used visualization techniques to identify the disease spots for better diagnosis. The review also summarises the studies that have used hyperspectral images for plant disease diagnosis and various data sources used by different studies. The challenges that currently exist while developing a plant disease diagnostic system and the shortcomings and open areas for research have also been discussed in this manuscript.
Bacterial symbionts can promote insecticide resistance in their hosts by isolating and degrading insecticidal compounds or altering the expression of host genes. Although Wolbachia , a common endosymbiont in arthropods, typically does not influence insecticide resistance, there are cases of increased or decreased susceptibility. Due to the restrictions of applying conventional insecticides in a stored product setting, studies on alternative control methods are needed, including those on entomotoxic nanoparticles and the potential for resistance. For pests of stored beans, selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) are relatively innocuous to the azuki bean beetle, Callosobruchus chinensis (L.) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae). Here, we hypothesized that this response is mediated by Wolbachia , and we tested this using an isofemale line of C. chinensis (infected or uninfected with Wolbachia ). Our results showed that the lifespan of Wolbachia -infected females was not affected by SeNPs, but increasing concentrations of SeNPs still had a negative effect on fecundity; in uninfected females, increasing concentrations of SeNPs significantly decreased both lifespan and fecundity. However, in males, SeNPs enhanced lifespan and decreased the incidence of sexual harassment behavior regardless of infection status (for uninfected males, the duration of harassment behavior also decreased). In the presence of males, 72-h female reproduction increased independent of infection status or SeNP treatment, but egg hatchability was reduced by male presence and SeNPs. This study documents a valuable example of symbiont-mediated resistance to entomotoxic nanoparticles.
Food safety and authenticity have become a serious concern among consumers worldwide. Economically motivated practices of food fraud can have widespread implications for public health and reduce the overall food quality. As such, there is a rapidly increasing requirement for more sensitive and accurate methods to detect deliberate adulteration of food commodities. An attempt to summarize the present status of adulterated foods, the most common adulterants used, and the non-destructive methods to detect food fraud, has been made in this review article. The techniques and modern methods of food adulteration detection including NIR, FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, NMR, e-nose/e-tongue, and LIBS have been discussed. The methods of qualitative and quantitative data analysis have a significant role in the determination of process efficiency and as such a comprehensive knowledge of the process and recent applications discussed in the review would be of high interest to solve food adulteration problems.
Hyperspectral Images, which are high-dimensional in nature and capture bands over hundreds of wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. These images have piqued researchers’ curiosity in the last two decades. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how researchers segmented and classified Hyperspectral Images with unbalanced data and few labelled training examples. For the sake of comprehension, the background of Hyperspectral Images and segmentation techniques is briefly discussed at first. The study is organised around different Hyperspectral Image processing techniques such as thresholding, clustering, watershed, deep learning, and other methods. The recent trends and developments in HSI segmentation have been reviewed and compiled using benchmark datasets such as Indian Pines, Salinas Valley, Pavia University, and others. Finally, it is intended that the readers will gain a thorough understanding of existing segmentation techniques, their performance, and fresh research areas for HSI that need to be studied or explored.
Soil fertility is at risk in intensive cropping systems when using an exclusive regime of inorganic fertilisers without returning sufficient organic matter to the soil. Our objective was to evaluate the long-term effects of commonly used organic amendments interacting with different rates of inorganic nitrogen fertiliser on crop yields of winter wheat. Yield data from winter wheat were collected for five seasons between 2013 and 2019 from a continuous field trial based at Rothamsted Research, SE England. Organic amendments (anaerobic digestate, compost, farmyard manure, and straw at a rate of 0 and 2.5 ton C per hectare) and five rates of inorganic nitrogen fertiliser (NH_4NO_3 at 0, 80, 150, 190, 220 kg N ha^−1) were applied to winter wheat grown in an arable rotation. At the same inorganic N rate, grain yields for the different organic amendment treatments (excluding the straw treatment) were statistically similar but significantly greater than the unamended control treatment. The nitrogen rate required for optimum yields tended to be lower in plots receiving a combination of organic amendments and mineral fertiliser. Based on the observed and modelled response functions, organic amendments excluding straw increased maximum achievable yields compared to non-amended controls. The size of the effect varied between seasons and amendments (+4.6 to +19.0% of the control yield), increasing the mean maximum achievable yield by 8.8% across four seasons. We conclude that the application of organic amendments can increase the yield potential in winter wheat substantially over what is achievable with inorganic fertiliser only.
The assignment of foods to one of four categories proposed by the Nova framework may be challenging in the absence of information on how these foods were prepared and their specific composition. A three-step iterative approach can make the categorization process more efficient and transparent, thereby increasing the accuracy of Nova estimates.
Germplasm banks are the most significant repository for plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (PGRFA) worldwide. Despite their strategic importance, national germplasm banks of tropical megadiverse developing countries such as Colombia have extremely limited funds. Therefore, making strategic decisions about research investment is essential. Here, we designed a data-driven approach to build an index that sorts Colombian PGRFA into three groups: high, medium, or low priority, based on four pillars of information from open-access databases and aligned with the sustainable goals of no poverty and zero hunger: Geographic origin, vulnerability status, economic benefits, and food security importance. We analyzed 345 PGRFA using the index, separating them into two groups, 275 already conserved in the Colombian germplasm bank (BGVCOL group) and 70 not currently conserved in the BGVCOL (NCB group). We used fuzzy logic to classify each PGRFA by each pillar and integrate it to obtain a priority index. Missing data for native crops were frequent in the BGVCOL group. Therefore we adopted an imputation strategy to fill the gaps and calculated the uncertainty. After applying the index, PGRFA with higher priority were 24 (8.72%) from the BGVCOL (i.e., 15 potatoes, three tomatoes, two tree tomatoes, pineapple, cocoa, papaya, and yacon) and one from NCB (i.e., coffee). We concluded that this methodology successfully prioritized PGRFA in Colombia and shows the big holes of knowledge for future research and alternatives to improve this index. The versatility of this methodology could be helpful in other genebanks with budget limitations for research investment.
Morinda citrifolia , widely known as “noni”, provides fruits of which it is a raw material not only for the preparation of foods, such as beverages, but is also used, for example, in the preparation of cosmetics. However, processing the fruit results in the generation of waste, in which the leaves represent the majority. Taking into account that noni leaves are proven to hold a high amount of bioactive compounds with phytotherapeutic properties, this study proposes the application of multi-stage block freeze concentration performed through the passive thaw method with the aid of the microwave-assisted technique to promote a greater speed and efficiency in the process of concentration of the bioactive components present in Morinda citrifolia L. leaves. The effect of the cryoconcentration steps on the physical, chemical and biological characteristics of the concentrated fractions and residual ice was evaluated in order to quantitatively verify presence and content of phenolics and total solids, viscosity, antioxidant activity, and bioavailability gastrointestinal in vitro. An increase in the phenolic and total solids values was observed at the end of the process, resulting in efficiency in the retention of phenolics above 90%. High-performance liquid chromatography assay detected catechin as bioactive compound of the largest amount in the final product. The use of the microwave-assisted concentration system allowed concentrated fractions with high biological, nutritional and phytotherapic value; indicating that the technique can contribute as a reference in the use of a sustainable technology in the generation of a promising product of high biological value, since the execution and elaboration of the microwave-assisted method allows for a lower energy consumption and waste production, in addition to providing less expensive and easy-to-operate tests.
Corn has been used as a raw material for ethanol production in several countries, and this product is used as fuel in vehicles to replace gasoline. However, before the industrial processing, harvested grains are stored at different times and temperatures. This project aimed to evaluate the impact of time and temperature of storage of corn grains in the production process of fuel ethanol. The assays evaluated six storage times (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 160 days) at three temperatures (25, 35, and 45ºC). The parameters of Brix, pH, total reducing sugars (TRS), total acidity, total phenolic compounds, and starch of the hydrolyzed corn paste samples were evaluated, as well as the Brix, pH, total acidity, glycerol, and alcohol content of wine samples. The experimental design was completely randomized, with the experiments carried out in 5 repetitions, and the results submitted for analysis of variance of the F Test and Tukey's Test 5%. It is noteworthy that the chemical-technological parameters of the pastes and the cell viability of the yeasts were not affected by the time and temperature of storage of the grains. However, the wine resulting from the fermentation process had a higher glycerol content and, consequently, a lower ethanol content after 90 days of storage. Storage temperature did not influence the parameters evaluated.
Bacillus thuringiensis ( Bt ) and its products are commonly used to control insect pests. The main issue with these bacteria is their limited field stability. These constraints fueled interest in using several molecular, biological, and biotechnological techniques to develop new recombinant Bt toxins with a broader insect spectrum, improved environmental stability and more efficient delivery of toxins to pest insects control. However, the potential environmental impact of using recombinant Bt strains and genetically engineered Bt crops includes gene flows into wild species and their unintended consequences on parasitoids and predators. The development of new hybrid/mutated Bt insecticidal toxins, with enhanced insecticidal activity and/or a broader spectrum of target insects, will continue to be a useful strategy for controlling resistant insect pests and delaying resistance evolution. Furthermore, the use of other genes encoding non- Bt proteins with insecticidal properties and different modes of action, such as protease inhibitors, lectins, cholesterol oxidases and chitinases, isolated from various sources will be critical in providing new weapons for the fight against insect damage. This review thoroughly describes recent advances and the most recent updates in the new potential applications of Bt , making it a remarkable new cell factory that can be employed to control pests.
Context Landscape fragmentation carries the risk of habitat loss for many animal species. This may include wild boars, which are one of the main culprits of conflicts with humans, while isolated patches of forest (forest islands) scattered in the agricultural landscape may affect its ecology and the pressure on the crops. Objectives This study aimed to understand the importance of small forest islands located in a human-dominated agricultural landscape in the ecology of wild boar. It explores what features, both of the interior and exterior of the islands, influence their use. Methods The study area covered approximately 220,000 ha of northern Poland, where wild boar use of 200 islands distributed across the agricultural landscape was investigated. For this purpose, the method of counting pellet groups was applied on transects of a total length of 51.6 km. In order to compare the use of islands with compact forest complexes, 84 km of transects were made in the latter, divided into developmental stages and forest type. Results Among the features of the interior of the islands, increasing cover conditions and the main species of trees (pine, spruce and alder) had a positive influence on the wild boar use. The utilization also depended on the presence of human settlements, other islands, and the type of agricultural crop around the island. When comparing island use to compact forest complexes, islands were used more often than forest regeneration sites and mature stands, but less often than pre-thickets. For the 25% most frequently used by wild boar, islands were more attractive than virtually all stand development stages in compact forest complexes. Conclusions Due to the cover conditions provided, the occurrence of islands in the agricultural space enables wild boars to use areas more distant from compact forest complexes. This may cause the spread of damage caused by wild boars in the fields, but on the other hand it may reduce the pressure on agricultural areas in the immediate vicinity of compact forest complexes. Intensification of hunting pressure in the vicinity of islands with specific characteristics e.g. good cover conditions, considerable distance from human settlements) will increase the effectiveness of wild boar population control in the agricultural landscape and will have a limiting effect on the damage caused by this species in the fields.
Plant requires seventeen essential mineral elements for proper growth and functioning classified as macro and micro-nutrients. Apart from these, cerium (Ce), cobalt (Co), iodine (I), aluminum (Al), selenium (Se), sodium (Na), lanthanum (La), silicon (Si), titanium (Ti), and vanadium (V) are evolving as pivotal bio-stimulants in plant growth and providing stress tolerance. Although, they are not mandatory for all plants directly but when they are supplemented, promote the plant growth positively and simulate multiple abiotic and biotic stresses tolerance. Though, these elements have crucial role in plant growth, still obscurethe uptake, transport and molecular understanding as much of macro and micronutrients. However, in recent years scientists are giving more emphasis to explore their mechanisms associated with enhancing antioxidant defense, stress responsive proteins accumulation, and transcription factors under variety of stresses. Likely, they are also crosstalk with other essential elements and plant growth regulators (PGRs) (salicylic acid, SA; jasmonic acid, JA), which is crucial for signaling network perception and regulate plant growth. Recent technologies developed in the field of nanotechnology assist in the further understanding of their uptake, transport and functions at cellular level andoptimizing their concentrations for better plant growth. Bio-fortification of crops with beneficial elements provides some cues regarding their importance in plant growth and also in human balance nutrition. To considering the importance of these compound, this review aimed to explore the uptake and transport mechanisms of beneficial elements and their function in plant development. Consequently, we pinpoint the crosstalk’s between PGRs and other mineral elements, which advance their crucial role during plant mineral nutrition and growth signaling. At the end, this review focused on the crucial role and mechanisms associated with these elements under multiple abiotic stresses that open exciting avanues in several directions related to crop stress breeding program.
The decrease in fossil fuel usage and the projected 28% increase in the global energy demand by 2040 are calling for advanced methods to convert modern biomass into fine chemicals. For instance, biomass-derived aldehydes appear as promising substitutes for the chemical and fuel industries. Here, we review electrochemical upgrading of furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural with a focus on catalysis and selectivity mechanisms. We also present hybrid water electrolysis systems for production of hydrogen and chemicals. We discuss electrochemical oxidation or hydrogenation of furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural using metal oxides, noble metals, transition metal nanoparticles and alloys, and nonoxides. We compare electrochemical processes with combustion, chemical, thermochemical, and biochemical processes for biomass conversion.
Overpopulation and rapid development have put an increasing burden on the environment, leading to various water crisis. Importing water from abandoned mines as an alternative raw water source could be the next answer to alleviate water scarcity problems globally. However, due to its high heavy metals content, there is a need to find an economical and effective method to remove heavy metals before reusing it as potable water source. Biochar, a low-cost and carbon-rich biosorbent, has received increasing attention on its application as a remediating agent to remove heavy metals from water. Previous studies have revealed the potential properties of biochar as a heavy metal removal agent including high cation exchange capacity, high surface area, active surface functional groups, as well as efficient adsorption. Apparently, the most important factor influencing the sorption mechanism is the type of feedstock materials. Spent mushroom compost (SMC), a waste product from mushroom cultivation, has been found as an excellent biosorbent. SMC has received global attention as it is low cost and eco-friendly. It also has been proved as an efficient heavy metals remover from water. Nevertheless, its application as biochar is still scarce. Therefore, this review focuses on the potential of transforming SMC into modified biochar to remove heavy metals, especially from abandoned mining water. The present review emphasizes the current trends in adsorption methods for heavy metal removal from water, assembles data from previous studies on the feedstock of biosorbents to biochars, and discusses the potentials of SMC as a biochar for water treatment.
This paper examines a model of agricultural development specifically centered on the role of cooperatives in augmenting social capital. The aim of the study is to investigate the impact of agricultural cooperatives on social capital formation and improved livelihoods in eight villages in the Aegean Region of Turkey (Bademler, Bağarası, Börezli, Gödence, Karakuzu, Kızıklı, Kuyumcu and Tire). We collected data using face-to-face semi-structured surveys. The results from frequency tables and social network analysis (SNA) support the hypothesis that membership in an agricultural development cooperative is a significant factor, which not only affects trust and augments social capital but also improves livelihoods in terms of income perception and eating habits.
De afgelopen decennia is het risico op nieuwe of opnieuw opduikende infectieziekten toegenomen. In een niet-immune populatie kan dit voor grote medische, maatschappelijke en economische problemen zorgen. Driekwart van de nieuwe ziekteverwekkers komt van (wilde) dieren. Wanneer deze pathogenen vervolgens ook van mens tot mens overdraagbaar zijn, kan dit tot een pandemie leiden, zoals bij COVID-19 is gebeurd. Huisartsen kunnen als een van de eersten humane signalen van nieuwe infectieziekten oppikken. Daarmee spelen ze een belangrijke rol bij de vroegtijdige opsporing en bestrijding ervan.
Bioactive compounds and healthful nutrient-rich fresh fruits and vegetables enrich our lives with nutrition and health. Discoloration due to enzymatic browning is one of the serious problems in fresh fruits and vegetables caused by activity of enzymes peroxidase (POD), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) in the presence of oxygen; it affects quality attributes (appearance, nutritional value) and decreases the economic value of fruit/vegetable products. Conventional techniques (blanching, chemical treatments, packaging, freezing, herbal treatments) are commercially used to tackle browning activity. These techniques affect fruit and vegetable quality attributes. Thus, to minimize the quality attribute loss, the application of emerging thermal and non-thermal techniques has been investigated. This review highlights the role of conventional techniques on browning inhibition and quality attributes, the emergence of advanced techniques, the role of advanced techniques on browning inhibition, the rate of inhibition of browning enzymes and its operating temperature, and time and pressure to decrease browning index. This article also examines shelf life, quality attributes, browning degree, and antioxidant and antimicrobial properties on the potential application of both conventional and emerging/advanced technologies in fruits and vegetables.
This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of using sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) for citric acid (CA) production and its impact on chemical oxygen demand (COD) of SSB. Five types of SSB were used as a carbon source for CA production by A. niger , and the COD of each SSB was measured before and after the bioprocess. Results showed that all tested SSB were suitable for CA production, with maximum yields ranging from 13.01 to 56.62 g L^− 1. The COD was reduced from 53 to 75.64%, indicating that the bioprocess effectively treated SSB wastes. The use of SSB as a substrate for CA production provides an alternative to traditional feedstocks, such as sugarcane and beet molasses. The low-cost and high availability of SSB makes it an attractive option for CA production. Moreover, the study demonstrated the potential of the bioprocess to simultaneously treat and reuse SSB wastes, reducing the environmental impact of the beverage industry.
Soybean ( Glycine max L.) is one of the most widely grown oilseed crops worldwide. Little is known about boron tolerance of soybean and although some authors state that it is a moderately tolerant species, they do not report its tolerance range. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of increasing boron concentrations in irrigation water on germination, growth and root anatomy of two soybean varieties (M 6210 and NS 8288). Standard germination and pot experiments, using different boron concentrations (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 and 8.0 mg.L^−1) were performed. Radicles obtained from germination assays were used to make cross sections that were examined under the microscope. Increasing boron concentrations reduced germination percentages (in NS 8288) and most of the growth variables evaluated, with significant differences between varieties. Symptomatology was observed above 1.0 mg.L^−1 B and was particularly pronounced in M 6210, which exhibited high leaf senescence and abscission. Maximum diameter of xylem vessels showed a gradual decrease in response to increasing boron concentrations in M 6210. This is the first study evaluating in detail the impact of boron toxicity on soybean varieties. Increasing boron concentrations cause a decrease in germination, growth and in the diameter of the xylem vessels. We suggest that the range of tolerance of the varieties here evaluated is lower than the one proposed by some authors for soybean and thus, further studies including more varieties is needed.
Agricultural residues have been identified as potential substrates for anaerobic digestion, which indicates them as alternative energy sources. But enzymatic hydrolysis of these residues has been observed as the rate-limiting step due to their recalcitrant characteristics. Therefore, pretreatment before anaerobic digestion is required to reduce the retention time and increase the methane yield. This study investigates the influence of thermal, alkali, acid, nanoparticle additive, and combined pretreatments on the methane yield of groundnut shells. The effect of pretreatment methods on the structural arrangement was investigated with scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared, and methane yield was investigated after anaerobic digestion at mesophilic temperature. The morphological analysis shows that all the treatment methods alter the microstructural arrangement of groundnut shells at varying degrees, except the particle size reduction, which does not significantly influence them. Cumulative methane yields of 222.92, 214.00, 171.02, 140.99, and 261.36 ml CH_4/g VS_added were recorded for thermal, alkali, acid, nanoparticle additive, and combined pretreatment methods, which represents 112.77, 70.03, 40.18, and 159.85% improvement compared to the untreated substrate (100.58 ml CH_4/g VS_added). Combined pretreatment was found to release the highest cumulative yield, and thermal pretreatment produced the least retention period. Therefore, combined and thermal pretreatments could be a bright means to deconstruct the recalcitrant characteristics of lignocellulose feedstocks arrangement to reduce the retention period and improve the methane yield. These methods can be experimented with further at the industrial scale to establish economic viability. Graphical Abstract 
Due to global warming, drought events have become more frequent, which resulted in aggravated crop failures, food shortage, larger and more energetic wildfires, and have seriously affected socio-economic development and agricultural production. In this study, a global long-term (1981–2021), high-resolution (4 km) improved vegetation health index (VHI) dataset integrating climate, vegetation and soil moisture was developed. Based on drought records from the Emergency Event Database, we compared the detection efficiency of the VHI before and after its improvement in the occurrence and scope of observed drought events. The global drought detection efficiency of the improved high-resolution VHI dataset reached values as high as 85%, which is 14% higher than the original VHI dataset. The improved VHI dataset was also more sensitive to mild droughts and more accurate regarding the extent of droughts. This improved dataset can play an important role in long-term drought monitoring but also has the potential to assess the impact of drought on the agricultural, forestry, ecological and environmental sectors.
The removal of the agricultural hazardous waste, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acids, from an aqueous solution in a batch method using a natural resource, was studied. The new bio-adsorbent prepared from Ritama-Monosperma (L.) Boiss powder, carbonized at 500 °C and activated with H_3PO_4, is characterized by different structural and textural characterization methods such as XRD, FTIR, SEM/EDX, Boehm titration, iodine value, and pHzpc. The influence of starting pH, temperature, and pesticide dose on the equilibrium, kinetics, and thermodynamics of adsorption was studied. Adsorption kinetics were tested using two simplified models, the pseudo-first-order kinetic model, and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model best fits the adsorption of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T on RMAC-P. On the other hand, in the concentration range examined, the equilibrium results reflect the Freundlich equilibrium model, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 69.44 mg/g for 2,4-D and 13.81 mg/g for 2,4,5-T. Density functional theory with local parameters reveals that the 2,4-D molecule has more nucleophilic centers than the 2,4,5-T molecule (N_2,4-D = 2.6426 eV, N_2,4,5-T = 2.6079 eV) showed by atoms C1, C2, C5, and C16, which explains the high capacity of adsorption of 2,4-D formed two types of liaison a π-π and n-π bond (formed between the benzene ring of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T and the rings of RMAC-P between the benzene ring of the pollutants and the acidic function and/or the phosphoric oxide sites); these results are in agreement with the experimental results.
Literature has proposed the existence of a cross kingdom regulation (CRK) between human and plants. In this context, microRNAs present in edible plants would be acquired through diet by the consumer’s organism and transported via bloodstream to tissues, where they would modulate gene expression. However, the validity of this phenomenon is strongly debated; indeed, some scholars have discussed both the methodologies and the results obtained in previous works. To date, only one study has performed a bioinformatics analysis on small RNA-sequencing data for checking the presence of plant miRNAs (pmiRNAs) in human plasma. For that investigation, the lack of reliable controls, which led to the misidentification of human RNAs as pmiRNAs, has been deeply criticized. Thus, in the present contribution, we aim to demonstrate the existence of pmiRNAs in human blood, adopting a bioinformatics approach characterized by more stringent conditions and filtering. The information obtained from 380 experiments produced in 5 different next generation sequencing (NGS) projects was examined, revealing the presence of 350 circulating pmiRNAs across the analysed data set. Although one of the NGS projects shows results likely to be attributed to sample contamination, the others appear to provide reliable support for the acquisition of pmiRNAs through diet. To infer the potential biological activity of the identified pmiRNAs, we predicted their putative human mRNA targets, finding with great surprise that they appear to be mainly involved in neurogenesis and nervous system development. Unfortunately, no consensus was identified within the sequences of detected pmiRNAs, in order to justify their stability or capability to be preserved in hum
